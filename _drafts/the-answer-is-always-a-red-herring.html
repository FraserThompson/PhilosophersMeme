<p>Q1: what's 2.3 + 3?</p>
<p>Depending on your answer, you might be part of the problem.<!--more--></p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>Depending on the context of calculation, the answer can only be as specific as its least specific input, i.e. 2.3 + 3 = 5. Remember significant digits? It's not as if 5.3 would be the 'real' answer and 5 a 'good enough' approximation... You literally can't obtain an answer more accurate than your least accurate input. Or was I talking about 2.3 + 3.0 but using shorthand notation?</p>
<p>Importantly: it's not as though 5 or 5.3, or really any specific answer is 'wrong', it's that any answer is premature and if you think I'm splitting hairs then you're part of an even bigger problem.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>Got a stiff drink nearby? You'll need it.</p>
<div>
<p>Most political discourse is guilty of this crime, but writ large. We ask vague questions yet demand precise answers. Political pundits or commentators unblinkingly ask a question like</p>
<blockquote><p><em>"should we bail out bank X?"</em></p></blockquote>
<p>That question is so vague as to be totally useless. Before any attempt at an answer, it's necessary to define... well, pretty much EVERY term in that sentence:</p>
<p>Who is "we"? Taxpayers? The government? The IMF? What's meant by "bail out"? Do you mean just give them a load of free money? Do you mean targeted stimulus/relief packages or some clever accounting tricks? etc. And what do you mean by "bank X"? The whole organisation? Just their loans or domestic trading division? While we're at it, what do you mean by "should"? What is your goal/aim in doing this? We need to know that before we can appraise whether we think it will work...</p>
<p>Vague vague vague, and yet that question could seriously be asked on a major news network tomorrow or could be discussed between two reasonable adults today who imagine they are having a serious discussion about politics.</p>
</div>
<p>Just as in the case of a mathematical question, you can't have output more precise than your input. Worse than that, the question is totally ill-posed but still gets treated as though it's talking about a single concrete issue as though everybody's starting premises/worldview are basically the same. Five minutes standing at a bus stop should be enough to convince you that's not true.</p>
<div>
<p>What makes this even worse is that any time you attempt to deconstruct the question, even just for some basic clarity, people call you out. Say your being difficult. Say you don't get it.</p>
<p>Outstanding.</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>Where does this problem come from? I blame the schools.</p>
<p>No, really.</p>
<p>Schools teach collections of facts and proxies for knowledge. Everything you are 'taught' in school is usually accepted on the authority of your teacher. Your physics teacher tells you that planes fly because of Bernoulli's principle and you just kind of accept it. You have to. It'll be on the test.</p>
<p>When you are educated in a system that emphasises memorisation of facts rather than reasoning deduction/discussion, then you have to find other ways of surviving. Accept facts based on authority is part of the survival strategy, but you also begin to learn to <em>pre-empt what answer the questioner wants.</em> Your teachers weren't telling you those things because they make you smarter, they were telling you those things because the exam-board will not give you an A without mentioning them... even if they are wrong.</p>
<p>Case in point: Bernoulli's principle does <strong>not</strong> explain lift forces.</p>
<p>When it comes to political discourse or indeed any discussion, most people will attempt to pre-empt the 'correct' answers and then argue along those lines. It's why if I say I'm going to ask you a question about Christopher Columbus your mind immediately starts preparing to answer, despite the fact you've not heard what I'm going to ask. Not only that, but that attitude seems <em>pragmatic</em> and <em>reasonable</em> to you.</p>
<p>IV.</p>
<p>More questions:</p>
<p>Q2: What currently living animal is most genetically similar to a Brontosaurus?</p>
<p>Q3: Does a Giraffe lay eggs or give birth to live young?</p>
<p>V.</p>
<p>Why did Q3 help you answer Q2? It got you to think from a different angle. Answering Q2, you were trying to remember if you've ever been taught that or where you've heard it. After hearing Q3, you would have been able to approach Q2 differently... thinking deductively instead of just trying to vomit facts that you may or may not know and may or may not be true.</p>
<p>This happens all the time, people learn facts, but not how to <em>use</em> them or how to <em>relate</em> them to solve problems. You know that plants photosynthesise and learned that CO2 is input and glucose is produced. You also know that a tree is mostly carbon. You were taught both of those things, and yet because you weren't told to, you likely never put those facts together to infer that acorns turn into oaks by getting that mass <em>literally out of thin-air.</em></p>
<p>Above, after thinking about how different creatures give birth (prompted by Q3), you were able to realise that Brontosaurus must be genetically similar to some creature that lays eggs and get a 'better' answer to Q2.</p>
<p>It's just a shame that <a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/12/09/166665795/forget-extinct-the-brontosaurus-never-even-existed">Brontosaurus never existed</a>.</p>
<p>Or <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-brontosaurus-is-back1/">might have done</a>.</p>
<p>Hm.</p>
<p>VI.</p>
<p>Your whole life you've been taught <em>what</em> to think but not <em>how</em> to think. You've been taught facts that are not only wrong, but were not even accepted by you based on your <strong>own</strong> wrongness... you accepted it based on somebody else's wrongness that you were taught to accept because they are an authority figure.</p>
<p>You've been taught how to compartmentalise information. How to memorise <em>factoids</em> and regurgitate them in the appropriate scenarios. You've been taught by the entire education system that being able to answer questions is what constitutes intelligence and that the best way to be capable of answering questions is to memorise the factoid answers and pre-empt which factoids the question might be asking about. You've been taught that an ability to do this is <em>desirable</em>, even <em>laudable</em>.</p>
<p>You were taught all of this because your education was not about you. It was at the convenience of your educators. Teaching you how to deconstruct a question, how to deconstruct 'facts' and how to pose your own questions (that can meaningfully be answered to your benefit) was never expedient to the goals of the educators.</p>
<p>It's much easier to teach you how to feel educated and informed rather than actually equip and arm you with the ability to reframe a question and obtain your own information.</p>
<p>VII.</p>
<p>A fetish is when something becomes an object of obsession in order to mask the absence of some other thing. I claim that education creates a fetishisation of information. In place of actual education and intellectual growth, schools teach students (and hence the adults of tomorrow) to value <em>possession of information</em> above all else. Knowing facts, stats, quotes and dates is considered intelligent. Better yet if you can effectively guess which of those factoids a question is asking you to regurgitate. I don't claim that this happens purposefully; the expediencies of industrial-scale education coupled with plunging investment in teaching create this system. Just sum the vector forces and solve for x.</p>
<p>Consider two people are asked how much fuel the Saturn V rocket had to burn to get off the ground. One gets out her pen and paper to start writing down some equations and the other is able to reel off the information from memory because he likes space rockets. Which one of these people is <em>intelligent</em>? Does it depend on the answer the first one eventually gives? Worse yet, does it depend on how close her guess is to the numbers the other guy memorised?</p>
<p>It takes a long time to break the spell.</p>
<p>VIII.</p>
<p>I lied earlier when I said vague questions are useless. It's actually worse than that, they're harmful because people become  convinced that this constitutes an actual discussion of a specific issue. Sorry for lying, but also not sorry because most people are already busy being lied to by themselves; pointlessly debating the conclusions instead of deconstructing the framing and form of the argument.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>"Unless you're talking about a synthetic value, 3 is the same as 3.0, and the sum is 5.3 as much as it is 5.300, because these are all representations of the same number."</p>
<p>Good point, but you're rationalising. If we're talking pure maths then what you say is right. The point is that nobody would think to ask what context I'm asking about. I decided the context, and I said you're wrong, and you're still trying to justify yourself.</p>
<p>Defending an wrong answer even after it's made clear the question was ill-posed is precisely what some talking head is doing on any one of the news channels <em>right now</em>. Don't believe me? Go and check.</p>
<p>Worried yet? No? Consider that it's happening in Government offices, Courthouses and Science Labs all over the world every day.</p>
