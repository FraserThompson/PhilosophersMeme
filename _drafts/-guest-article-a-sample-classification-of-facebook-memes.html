<p><strong>By Stephen Ryan.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Facebook memes have reflected the rise of the social platform as an accessible, convenient source of humour for its users, integrated directly into the newsfeed. Meme pages have spawned a community of their own, interacting with each other, competing for fans and putting their respective spins on currently trending memes. They have been established long enough to evolve and develop complexity, and as such I have attempted here to perhaps document some of the variety and suggest some possible links or relationships. Bear in mind that the treatment here only extends to a small list of common items, and that there is a much wider ecosystem to be explored.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any complex system needs simple definitions, so first I would like to split the term “meme” into two separate entities, the “macro-meme” and the “micro-meme”, and define them both. The macro-meme definition is the standard definition of the original word “meme”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MACRO-MEME: any element of a culture or system of behaviour passed from one individual to another by imitation or other non-genetic means.</p>
<p>MICRO-MEME: any text, image or video which requires more than basic human culture to be understood.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>‘Basic human culture' should be interpreted as things every single person knows and feels; it is something anyone from any culture has. This assumes no language barrier.</p>
<p>Most memes require previous knowledge and context to be understood; the prefixes “macro”- and “micro-“ refer to the number of people who fully understand the meme. Macro-memes are generally culture-wide, while micro-memes are directed at smaller groups of people. Macro-memes require no previous knowledge to understand, but micro-memes do.</p>
<p>For this post I will consider only micro-memes in the form of text, image or video, and which are also designed to be humorous. There are also many micro-memes in the real world to which a lot of the following can be applied, but I will limit myself to only referencing internet memes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NORMIE: A person who typically only enjoys pre-ironic memes.</p>
<p>One consequence of this is that anything that can be intuitively and fully understood is not a micro-meme, i.e. “rage comics” are micro-memes but cartoons are not, and that while a normie posting “nice meme’” is not a micro-meme, the posting of it by a person with the intention of irony is one, because the irony will not be recognised by a normie. Longcat is macro, because it is intuitively understood by most people, but Bad Luck Brian is micro.</p>
<p>Many different communities have developed, each catering to their selected group. As such we need to introduce a term to refer to the specific group of users who make up a community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HOME CULTURE: the specific community of users that the meme is aimed at, along with their beliefs and attitudes.</p>
<p>This definition of a micro-meme is too general to be useful categorizing memes. Sites such as KnowYourMeme and Encyclopediadramatica typically document each individual instance of a meme but fail to understand the larger gist, similar to how a dictionary can only help you so far to understand puns. A solution to this that I have found is to use the fact that every micro-meme arises from the application of a specific concept onto another concept or narrative for comedic effect. Once the core concept that has been applied to the original concept or narrative is identified, it is possible to group an extremely diverse set of memes into well-defined groups. Here are a few examples of applied concepts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EXAMPLES OF APPLIED CONCEPTS</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-746" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/micro.jpg" alt="micro" width="960" height="960" /></p>
<p>• the conveying of a concept through image macros which have an innate meaning external to the applied concept which is known by the home culture (e.g. Scumbag Steve).<br />
• the exaggeration of a concept that is regarded as un-self-aware by the home culture (e.g. black social media slang).<br />
• the posting of a text, image or video which is regarded as un-self-aware by the home culture (e.g. copypasta).<br />
• the posting of a non-sequitur which is regarded as alien or inappropriate by the home culture (e.g. Did you ever here about the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise? I thought not.)<br />
• the posting of a concept in such a way that it is only recognizable to the home culture (e.g. CADbortion).<br />
• the posting of the application of an applied concept to itself or another applied concept (e.g. if a meme wore pants, would he wear them like this or this?)<br />
• the posting of a concept with additional information which does not actually supply any extra information (e.g. the posting of a concept with additional information which does not actually supply any extra information)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is also informative to consider WHY a micro-meme is perceived as humourous. This is naturally extremely subjective, but with a little thought it is easy to identify where the humour stems from of ANY comedic item. Below is a list of common techniques that are used in comedy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>COMMON TECHNIQUES OF COMEDY:</p>
<p>• surprise<br />
• relatability<br />
• exaggeration<br />
• word/concept play<br />
• absurdity (non-sense)<br />
• sexual reference<br />
• inappropriate use of socially serious concepts<br />
• things the viewer considers below themselves (superiority)<br />
• recognition of references<br />
• protective instinct/cuteness</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most comedic things are a mixture of the above, and some are even linked strongly with one another. It can depend on the person which they consider the bigger factor in making something humorous. A few examples of normie use of these techniques would be for example the relatability of Michael McIntyre, the dark humour of Frankie Boyle, and the caricatures of political cartoons. Find a random “funny” image in your newsfeed and try to identify which of the techniques it uses; it should be relatively simple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is important to remember that laughter is NOT comedy. Laughter is often used as a conversation filler, to show appreciation, to humour somebody, and an instrument to socially “fit in” with. It should be remembered that laughter is more a tool than an effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With this we can begin to group our memes with similar traits together and to identify how various memes work. We know the concept the meme uses, and how each concept uses a mixture of comedic techniques to be humorous. Here is an explanation of four common types of micro-memes, with both the specific concept and the comedic technique outlined, and a picture with explicit examples of the meme types.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE PRE-IRONIC MEME: The first step of the micro-meme movement. They are simple and require very little previous knowledge to be understood, and are the foundations of most other types of memes. Their main concept is image macro use, and their comedic techniques are usually relatability or superiority. Often they use images which give the viewer an expectation, context, or guidance about a narrative or joke, of which the meanings are pre-determined and have to be learned, making them micro. Their biggest defining factor is that none of them are ironic. See <a class="profileLink" href="https://www.facebook.com/VirginRadioLebanon/">Virgin Radio Lebanon</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE IRONIC MEME: A direct successor to pre-ironic memes, these developed as a reaction to what became seen as childish or basic humour. Thus their main comedic techniques are superiority, exaggeration, surprise and absurdity. Their main applied concepts are exaggeration (exaggeration being both a technique and a concept) and copypasta.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE COUNTER-MEME: A sideways successor to ironic memes, i.e. they are post-ironic. They developed after people became bored of the excessive satire of ironic memes, and oppose irony with brute sincerity. Their only concept is useless information, their techniques are surprise and word/concept play. See <a class="profileLink" href="https://www.facebook.com/TheseAreNotMemes/">This is not a Meme Page</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE META-IRONIC MEME: Another sideways descendant to the ironic, these oppose satire by applying even more satire. Typically they are illogical combinations of memes that arise from the application of exaggeration to exaggeration - an ironic meme of an ironic meme, but they can also use abstractness or minimalism to present memes in a way that has not been done before. Their concepts are exaggeration and the application of an applied concept to itself or another applied concept, and their comedic techniques are exaggeration, superiority, absurdity and word/concept play.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>END NOTES</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where will memes go next? The answer is difficult, but I think the answer lies in the art world. A similar strain of sincerity, irony and reactionary styles is to be seen in art, and it is possible that by studying the history of painting an educated guess can be made. Perhaps memes will come full circle - and we will enjoy sincerity once again, but as long as man must prove himself, the only enjoyment will come from being one among few.</p>

<p><em>editor's comment:</em></p>
<p>The macro/micro divide here assumes</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Insofar as they describe the 'sizes' of memes, the micro/macro divide must refer to some quantity. The fact that complex memes tend to be smaller in niche does not make complexity interchangeable with micromemeticity. We can imagine a quadrant made up of complexity and size axes; the size of a meme would then refer not simply to the number of people which carry it but the system of meme behind each instance of a meme object.</p>
<p>If the size of a meme refers to the memetic network supporting its meaning, this simply refers to complexity. If it refers to the size of the cultural memeplex which provides its habitat, it is not a descriptor of a meme qua meme-object at all, but of associated cultures and behaviours. It can therefore only usefully mean a combination of the two, which is tantamount to a description of memes as cultural progressions leaving artifacts as it goes.</p>
<p>The confusion arises from the terminological ambiguity left over from classical memetics in which a meme is an aspect of human behaviour and psychological states. Memes qua gene analogues is as relevant a concept as ether is to chemistry--a placeholder for clumsy past attempt at a scientific conservatism of working within the established system. My own hypothesis--that memes are simulated organisms--is a far more promising and pragmatic choice in the operationalization of memetics. Internet memes are well justified in claiming the conventional use of 'memes' for themselves, being a paradigmatic example of operationalizable memes.</p>
