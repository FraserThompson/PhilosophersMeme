<p>Thoughts, comments and critique of one of the most acclaimed game series of all time. Massive unapologetic spoilers throughout. <!--more--></p>
<p>Before we go any further, it is strongly recommended that you play these games first in order to get the most out of my discussion of their design and philosophy, as I will assume a high level of familiarity with the game's story, characters and gameplay. Seriously, if you own a PS3, <em>Metal Gear Solid 1</em> and the <em>Metal Gear Solid HD Collection (MGS2, MGS3, MGS:PW)</em> are very affordable on the Playstation store, and <em>Metal Gear Solid 4</em> is available on disc much cheaper than on the PlayStation store. I personally played <em>Metal Gear Solid V:</em> <em>Ground Zeroes</em> on PS3 as well.</p>
<p>If you've really enjoyed the series, <em>Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</em> is also worth playing, but is a departure from the rest of the series in many ways and still fairly expensive. I'll go out on a limb and say it's the least necessary game in terms of story, as it does little to build on <em>Ground Zeroes</em> and does almost nothing to bridge towards the (chronologically) later games.</p>
<p>I'll be making the decision to split comments/critique of the game and it's design and the same for the philosophy and ideas that the game presents to the extent that this is possible.</p>
<p><strong><em> Metal Gear Solid</em> (Playstation - 1998)</strong></p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>Often seen alongside the likes of <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>  and <em>Abe's Oddysee </em>as one of the 'killer apps' of the original Playstation, <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> represented a huge leap forward in video-game design, production and ambition.</p>
<p>Whilst technically the third instalment in the series (preceded by <em>Metal Gear</em> and <em>Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake </em>both on the MSX2 home computer), this was the gateway drug for the majority of the fans. Before the release of Metal Gear Solid, only diehard fans of Japanese imports had ever heard of series creator Hideo Kojima - nowadays widely regarded as the closest thing the video-game world has to an "auteur".</p>
<p>The previous games had seen European and North American releases, although Kojima recognised that many players would not have played them, and as such <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> includes an option on the main menu to get an introduction to series protagonist Solid Snake and a contextualisation of his mission. This animated cutscene makes allusions to the events of the previous games (Solid Snake defeating Big Boss, the leader of a terrorist uprising, who it later transpired was Snake's 'father' although more on that later.... a lot more).</p>
<p>It was a clever decision then, and it's a lesson that many modern games appear to have forgotten. Putting story-content as an 'opt-in' option somewhere allows veteran players to hop right into the game without having to re-watch cutscenes. At least, it would, except that <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> unfurls  5 minues of cutscenes and radio conversations immediately after pressing start. Whilst it's easy to criticise the game for what could be called an overuse of cinematic techniques for it's storytelling and scene-setting, it should also be remembered that prior to this, no games had been capable of even attempting to bring cinematic techniques into video-games. Critics often chastise modern games for trying too hard to emulate films, but <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> came out when the practise was not commonplace and in fact set the bar for the future of storytelling in the medium. The game starts as it means to go on and while much of the plot and characterisation occurs during cutscenes, the game deserves praise for integrating these very well. There's no real reason why the sketchy cartoon style of the characters during codec conversations should fit so well with the in-engine cinematics, but they do and few players would have it any other way.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>It's probably worth providing a rundown of the basic plot: An elite military unit known as 'Foxhound' have gone rogue and seized a nuclear disposal facility and taken the facility staff as hostages. They threaten to fire a nuke unless they are given $1bn and the corpse of legendary soldier-turned-terrorist 'Big Boss' who was killed by former Foxhound member Solid Snake. Snake is called out of retirement and tasked with securing the safety of hostages taken during the uprising and neutralising the terrorists, including their leader 'Liquid Snake'. Unbeknownst to Snake, the facility is actually a development lab for a prototype walking tank that carries a railgun capable of launching nuclear warheads in a way that sidesteps international nuclear arms treaties (as it's not a 'missile') and is impossible to detect or intercept as it doesn't use propellant. Snake later discovers that this was the 'real' reason for the mission; he has been sent to neutralise Foxhound before word gets out about the development of Metal Gear, although even this is not the whole truth.</p>
<p>Almost as soon as the game has begun, characters compliment Snake for his strength and legendary status as a solider who's prowess rivalled even that of Big Boss. Whilst Snake deflects most of these compliments, Mantis (after reading his memory card... I mean, mind) remarks that part of Snake enjoys the killing. It's quite a powerful message for a game that will have forced the player to kill in order to progress up to that point. <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> never paints a black and white picture of war and extends that message into it's gameplay. On some level, the game wants players to enjoy being Solid Snake, sneaking around and snapping the necks of guards who are in the way, but the story condemns revelry in the killing.</p>
<p>Aside from the ethics of the battlefield, the characters also spend a lot of time (all fully voice acted and largely optional!!) discussing the current state of the world in terms of nuclear arms treaties and the aftermath of the cold war. Nastasha, Otacon and Snake himself all condemn the madness of the mutually assured destruction doctrine without ever being overly idealistic and spend a lot of time dissecting the current human condition of living in a world that could end so quickly. Similarly to how the game treats it's theme of war and killing, <em>MGS</em> never preaches too heavily about the ethics of nuclear armament, instead largely allowing the player to make their own mind up, whilst simultaneously being in Snake's shoes; it doesn't matter what you think, it's irrelevant to your mission.</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>The game itself is often seen as the platonic form of a stealth'em up. Fast-paced, yet tactical and involved. The first half of the game set the standard for stealth and action games. Snake's life gauge starts out incredibly small, taking only 2 or 3 hits to deplete to zero, and whilst it is possible to evade guards after triggering an alert phase, early on in the game it's almost certain death. Snake's life gauge only increases later in the game so that Snake stands more of a chance in boss battles, but by that time the player is expected to have internalised the mechanics and 'philosophy' of the game: detection == failure.  This creates a nice pseudo-binary game-state: you're either stealthing perfectly or you've 'failed' and have been detected, usually leading to a 'game over'. That simplicity combined with the fast pace and variety of maps and guard layouts early on creates a very satisfying game to play and shows a decent respect to players to be able to understand and internalise the game-rules.</p>
<p>It's a shame that the second half tends to opt for set-pieces rather than straightforward stealth and evasion. To name but a few of these; fighting guards whilst running up a lot of stairs, running down a lot of stairs, rappelling down a building, evading automated gun-turrets, forced confrontations with guards in elevators, a higher density of boss battles... the second half of the game is a lot weaker than the first, and after the battle with Sniper Wolf, the number of stealth sections featuring Snake evading patrolling guards drops significantly. I imagine that this was to do with time-constraints during development. Whatever the reason was it's had a hugely detrimental effect on the latter half of the game. Over-reliance on cheap traps (invisible mines and gun-turrets concealed by the map geography/camera angle) makes the second half feel as though it was designed to slow players down before they sprint to the final section.</p>
<p>Later stages also make hefty use of backtracking. Aside from at least two trips to the armoury (C4, PSG1), and the retread of the first two buildings after escaping from captivity, Snake also has to ride the funicular elevators after the snowfield three times during the PAL keycard segment. These were most likely in order to get the most out of the dev-time required to create those assets. Re-using the maps in this fashion is a clever choice from a design perspective, but is a somewhat transparent method of padding out the length of the game. I'm not convinced that the game-length was padded in order to get away with providing cheap thrills, but rather as a way of pacing the story in the final hours of gameplay and providing space for the plot-twists to unfurl themselves without feeling too densely packed.</p>
<p>One final criticism of the game design is the Soliton radar that shows the layout of the map and positions of guards. It's inclusion in the game is something of a paradox from a design perspective. The previous <em>Metal Gear</em> games were able to display entire are maps, whereas <em>Metal Gear Solid</em>'s camera is pulled in much closer to Snake and severely limits the players view-range. The Soliton radar allows players to see much further than the game-camera allows, but it's easy to become fixed on it as it provides adequate information for sneaking through most areas.</p>
<p>IV.</p>
<p>The game is split across two discs, so it's clear that Kojima didn't want to compromise on compression of audio or textures, but with the rendering abilities of the original PlayStation being what they were, perhaps it was not possible to provide a wider view on the game environment without having to sacrifice the look of the game world. Thus the paradox: the game is 3D and has fully rendered environments which cannot be fully displayed on-screen and hence the player is going to spend most of their time looking at a crude vector-drawing of the game environment. The trap-doors and 'jamming' of the radar is a nice way to force players to not be overly reliant on it, but it's still a shame there isn't a more elegant solution the team could have employed.</p>
<p>As I said earlier, <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> represented a huge leap forward in terms of video game storytelling and production. The first noticeable difference from contemporary games was the use of full voice-acting for every cutscene, conversation and in-game effects. Snake's voice became almost immediately iconic and is probably one of the reasons he is such a beloved video game character. David Hayter's gravelly delivery walks a fine line between cheesy and edgy, but ultimately sounds incredibly grounded and believable despite the bizarre setting of the game.</p>
<p>The use of the CD format for storing the game's huge amount of audio isn't the only place where Kojima and co made full use of the hardware. During the Psycho Mantis fight, Mantis claims to be able to read Snake's mind and will check the player's memory card and comment on the presence (or lack) of save-files for other Konami games. Mantis also checks to see if the player has a 'rumble' controller and uses the rumble feature to 'psychokinetically' move the control pad across a surface. Later in the game, Naomi also uses the rumble feature to soothe the players arm (using the controller like a massager) after the strenuous 'torture' sequence where the player is required to mash the circle button in order to prevent Snake's life gauge from depleting while he is electrocuted.</p>
<p>Other notable moments include having to switch the control ports to defeat Mantis's mind-reading and him 'switching the channel' of your TV to disorient you (although in actual fact it cannot do this, although I am in no doubt that if Kojima could have changed the tuning on your TV he would have done...), the Colonel and Nastasha telling Snake to use the stereo-sound in order to keep track of where an enemy Helicopter is during a duel (and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG8Sty9veI" target="_blank">mocking you</a> if you have your sound settings on 'mono')... even the back of the CD case gets used as a gameplay prop.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_909" align="aligncenter" width="505"]<img class="aligncenter wp-image-909" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ps1_metalgearsolid_back_eu.jpg" alt="ps1_metalgearsolid_back_eu" width="505" height="378" /> 140.15[/caption]</p>
<p>In short, you can tell that Kojima and his team cared deeply about the game as a whole package, using every piece of hardware, software and narrative device that they had at their disposal. To this day, <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> is touted as one of the first games to display such huge ambition, not only in terms of storytelling but also in terms of attention to detail and creation of something greater than the sum of its parts.</p>
<p>The game itself is littered with special items, techniques and secrets (a camera that can take photographs to show the ghosts of the game devs in specific areas, getting a Wolfcub to piss on a cardboard box that Snake can hide in to sneak past adult Wolves as it has a Wolf scent, at least three ways of escaping from the torture chamber, and hours of optional dialogue if the player obsessively uses the Codec). The enemy A.I. is often the butt of jokes, but even for today, many small touches help flesh them out as believable (if somewhat incapable) enemies. Simple things like investigating noises and following Snake's footprints aren't difficult to implement but help the guards feel like a more organic and dynamic adversary than the many gun-turrets that populate the game's later stages.</p>
<p>Every piece of hardware is taken into consideration and used in some intelligent or novel way. Although the voice-acting and epic amount of cutscenes are easy to point to as the 'watershed moment' in video-game storytelling (the first time a video game was telling a story that rivalled a feature film), the 4th wall breaking, self-aware and sandbox-like game environment also helped push forward what would be expected in future, not just from Kojima, but from games in general.</p>
<p>V.</p>
<p>Over the course of the game, it transpires that 'Big Boss' was not just Solid Snake's father... Solid Snake was is in fact a clone of Big Boss, along with Liquid Snake. Solid and Liquid were created as clones of the legendary solider, one clone being a manifestation of all of the 'dominant' soldier genes, and the other being the product of the 'recessive' genes from Big Boss' genome.</p>
<p>Whilst the understanding of 'dominant' and 'recessive' genes is shaky at best, the point is that one of the clones was meant to be the perfect soldier, whilst the other a throw-away. Liquid believes himself to be the inferior clone and resents Solid Snake for killing Big Boss and robbing him of the chance to exact revenge against the 'father' he believe had cursed him to live his life as an unwanted and defective by-product.</p>
<p>These two themes - the ethics of combat and the nature of identity - dovetail together in the final section of the game. Having defeated the titular <em>Metal Gear</em> and effectively neutralised the terrorists and their nuclear launch capability, Snake is forced to confront Liquid face to to face. Liquid reveals his belief that he was the inferior clone and rails against Snake for having lost his way, fighting on behalf of a government and country that have used him and lied to him. Of particular insult is the fact that Snake was unknowingly infected with an artificial virus prior to his mission, 'Foxdie' which is programmed to specifically target members of Foxhound and give them simulated heart attacks before vanishing without a trace. Snake's true mission was to act as an unwitting assassin; simply come into contact with the members of Foxhound, infect them with the Foxdie virus, and then die himself - neatly tying up any loose ends or evidence of the event.</p>
<p>Liquid explains that before being killed by Snake, Big Boss's goal was to create a paradise on earth for soliders - a nation where the strong lead and warriors are free to fight for themselves instead of being used by corrupt governments. This 'Outer Heaven' was Big Boss' dream, and being a clone of Big Boss, Liquid sees it as his destiny to help it come to fruition. He also reveals that the soldiers Snake has been fighting this whole time were all treated with a gene therapy technique that has implanted the DNA of Big Boss into them all. Liquid effectively accuses Snake of turning his back on his genetic destiny and of killing his own 'brothers'.</p>
<p>Following a one-on-one confrontation, Snake defeats Liquid and attempts to escape the facility, chased by Liquid as US air force stealth bombers approach to level the entire compound and erase all trace of the uprising. At the climax of the chase scene, with Snake trapped and helpless before him, Liquid aims his weapon and collapses, suffering a heart attack caused by the Foxdie virus. Snake seems miraculously unaffected and rides off into the sunset whilst Naomi, the creator of Foxdie tells him that she doesn't know how long he has left, but it's important that he choose to live.</p>
<p>Depending on your actions in the game, Snake escapes either with Otacon or Meryl. Later games have established the Meryl ending as canon, although it's likely that Kojima never intended either ending to be more canonical as special items are awarded for both endings. An infinite ammo bandana for Meryl's ending and invisibility camouflage for Otacon's ending. Neither item is really all that useful if the player is playing the game properly but they do allow for some replayability in terms of experimentation (using the stealth camo to test the A.I.s limitations or using infinite ammo to level the playing field in boss battles) which is a decent reward.</p>
<p>VI.</p>
<p>The core philosophical idea is that of genetic predestination. Naomi, the geneticist reveals that she was adopted and got into genetics because she thought it would tell her about who she was and what she should do with her life, but after a lifetime of study was left empty-handed. Liquid says explicitly "you can't fight your genes" and has chosen a path of attempting to manifest his 'destiny', however he is ultimately killed by a weapon that targets him precisely because of his genes. The twist of the story is that it is in fact Snake who was the inferior clone. He was inferior, and yet he was still able to defeat both Big Boss and Liquid. Snake made choices in his life and refused to be ruled by his fate and survives even the Foxdie virus which is meant to target him specifically.</p>
<p>It's a charming message, perhaps simple but difficult to disagree with. Our DNA isn't the whole of who we are and allowing yourself to be 'chained to fate' is the ultimate rejection of life. Liquid chose to live by his DNA and died by it. Snake refuses to accept that he is doomed to any fate by his DNA and hence survives. This theme of identity and the nature of the self/other eventually became the core philosophical interest of the series. Whilst each game touches on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMWodfajOVU" target="_blank">many interesting ideas</a>, identity is the foremost. <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> begun this exploration of identity with the concept of <em>gene</em>, ultimately deciding that our genes do not and cannot characterise fully who and what we are. Human choice is capable of overriding genetic identity. We can choose the kind of life we want to lead and then lead it.</p>
<p><strong>Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty (Playstation 2 - 2001)</strong></p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>In practically every way, <em>Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty</em> improved on the core experience of it's predecessor. Most obvious is the huge increase in sophistication of the graphics. In the 3 years since the previous game, an entirely new console generation had been released with vastly improved capabilities. Aside from the obvious though, the gameplay itself had been hugely expanded in scope. The core gameplay is still much the same, but with marked improvements to the player's moveset. First-person aiming is now possible for the majority of weapons which changes the dynamics of the combat remarkably (landing head-shots immediately kills or incapacitates enemies, while shooting their weapons/radios can disable them).</p>
<p>In fact, the series was so acclaimed by then, that being packaged with a demo of <em>Metal Gear Solid 2</em> is often cited as the primary driving force behind sales of Kojima's game from earlier that year, <em>Zone of the Enders</em>. Such was the level of anticipation amongst fans and newcomers to the series excited to play the next chapter in the story of Solid Snake.</p>
<p>Except, MGS2 isn't Snake's story. At least, not completely.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p><em>Metal Gear Solid 2</em> is split into two chapters. The <em>Tanker</em> chapter and <em>Plant</em> chapter. The shorter <em>Tanker</em> chapter sees Solid Snake infiltrate a US Navy ship that is transporting a prototype <em>Metal Gear</em> being developed by the Marine Corps and leak photographs of the weapon to the world press. This is a marked shift from the approach of the first game. Rather than destroy the Metal Gear prototype, Snake's mission (and this time, <em>intention</em>) is merely to expose the hypocrisy/corruption of the world superpowers and defer responsibility and direct action to the international community.</p>
<p>After this brief introduction which introduces all of the basic gameplay elements (enemies, sneaking, radar, combat and even a boss battle), Revolver Ocelot resurfaces and announces his intention to steal the prototype <em>Metal Gear Ray.</em> Ocelot is interrupted when his replacement transplant arm - which used to belong to Liquid Snake - fights for control over his body and then proceeds to attack Snake claiming to <strong>be</strong> Liquid Snake. Liquid Ocelot steals <em>Ray</em> and scuttles the Tanker with Snake's fate left uncertain. We skip ahead two years to meet new protagonist,<em> Raiden</em>.</p>
<p>Raiden is a new recruit into Snake's old unit, Foxhound, which have reformed since the uprising in the previous game. Raiden is tasked with infiltrating the 'Big Shell', an offshore facility dedicated to cleaning up the oil spill created 5 years ago when Solid Snake - now explicitly branded a terrorist - attacked a civilian ship and caused it to sink off the coast of Manhattan. At first, Raiden is referred to as 'Snake', but his codename is changed shortly after the game begins.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that nobody at all had been expecting Snake to be replaced as protagonist at all and none of the promotional material in the year leading up the game's release had featured Raiden prominently (he was in the background of a few promotional gameplay photographs) and certainly no mention had been made of him as a character. Raiden's situation is similar to the player in that sense... he enters Big Shell expecting to be 'Snake' but is told shortly after arriving that he is actually 'Raiden'.</p>
<p>For seasoned players, this was a massive shock. Solid Snake himself had become iconic and he was regarded as one of (if not <strong>the</strong>) the main selling points of the previous game. His voice and attitude were liked and his triumph at Shadow Moses had made him into a legend (which ironically is not what he wanted at the beginning or the end of MGS1). Players were shocked then to not only <strong>not</strong> be playing as Snake, but being cast as a character that is practically the antithesis to Snake. Even at the start of MGS1, Snake was a battle-hardened veteran, gruff and handsome who flirted outrageously with the female characters and quipped wittily with his adversaries. Raiden on the other hand is a complete rookie, effeminate looking and whiny, struggles to maintain his pre-existing relationship with Rose and is often left speechless when taunted by other characters. It cannot be stated enough what a huge blow to player expectations this was, and it's introduced fairly early into the game. We'll get back to that later though.</p>
<p>Continuing with the story, Raiden is told that the Big Shell has been seized by a terrorist group calling themselves "The Sons of Liberty", and that their leader claims to be none other than Solid Snake. Raiden's mission is to rescue the hostages - of whom one is the President - and neutralise the Sons of Liberty. Pretty quickly though, things start going wrong. Firstly, the sons of liberty are being assisted by a US Navy anti-terror training squad known as 'Dead Cell', whose ranks include explosive expert Fatman, invincible 'lady luck' Fortune, and bizarre knife-wielding vampire Vamp. Fatman has rigged the Big Shell to explode, forcing Raiden to first contend with disarming the explosives before he can confront Dead Cell.</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>The Plant chapter is where MGS2 really kicks off. The fundamental gameplay is the same, but there are notable differences to the game scenario. Most notably, the Big Shell is basically open to explore from the start. In contrast to the fairly linear design of Shadow Moses island from MGS1, the Big Shell is formed of 14 struts, two hexagons of 6 struts surround the two cores and these two hexagons are linked across a bridge. Although at first the Big Shell looks like a hugely expanded game environment and while it is true that the player is far more free to explore however they please, it should be noted that this design really serves to mask how linear the game still is...</p>
<p><img class="irc_mi aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/big-shell.jpg" alt="" width="679" height="509" /></p>
<p>For starters, the layout of Big Shell means that to navigate between struts, the player is actually restricted to travelling clockwise or anti-clockwise around the hexagon. One of the T-shaped bridges to Core-1 is destroyed in a cutscene the first time it is encountered meaning that travelling 'through' the core as a shortcut is never an option. The second core is also mostly destroyed by the time Raiden is ready to move there and hence only Core-2 is actually playable with the other 5 struts never actually used, the final strut is travelled 'through' on the way back to Core-1..</p>
<p>Big Shell is an improvement on the linearity of Shadow Moses but only a little, and the freedom offered to the player is mostly illusory and only really pertinent to gameplay during the bomb-disposal... the rest of the game proceeds to give Raiden instruction to navigate to specific struts to advance the plot making the more open game environment a redundant luxury rather than an integral part of the gameplay. Secondly, the second half of the game drops the exploration in favour of set-pieces, echoing the pacing of MGS1.</p>
<p>This is not the only change though. Raiden is also not automatically given a radar-map of the Big Shell struts, and must visit a terminal in each strut to 'unlock' the map. Many of the Big Shell struts are smaller and indoors which means that this mechanic recalls the worst moments of MGS1 when the limited on-screen view meant walking into an enemies line of sight simply because the enemy is offscreen. It felt cheap in MGS1 but the maps were designed to limit that problem. Here it feels like a lazy way to add challenge where none is required. Being killed by things that Raiden could clearly see but the player cannot owing to the top-down camera is a shameful immersion-break. Whilst the newly enhanced first persob view mode is much slicker and fluid than before, constantly dipping into first person mode to check the environment still completely destroys the pace of the gameplay, which is otherwise mostly quite fast having carried over from MGS1. I'd go so far as to say the way the radar mechanics conflict with the level design is probably the only major blunder in MGS2.</p>
<p>After making his way around Core 1 disarming bombs, Raiden confronts a few bosses and eventually learns that the reason for the President's visit to Big Shell was not to oversee the oil cleanup. Astute players will have remembered that there was no oil on the Tanker, only <em>Metal Gear</em>. Big Shell is a cover-up operation that is now being used as the development site for a brand new <em>Metal Gear</em> project. Raiden is emasculated further in his first boss encounter. There is no way to damage Fortune in her boss battle (although the game tempts you by giving her a tiny life-bar), and instead Raiden must simply survive until the elevator arrives and make his escape.</p>
<p>The bosses of MGS2 are mostly fairly forgetful unfortunately. The battle with Fortune simply requires the player to survive. The battle against Fatman reuses the bomb-disposal mechanic -the player will have by now grown tired of- but is not otherwise particularly interesting as the player doesn't have access to many weapons. The battle against Vamp is good if only because it pushes the new aiming controls to their limit as well as a few other neat gimicks. Raiden fights a Harrier that plays out almost identically to the Hind fight from MGS1 and finally Raiden confronts.... well, let's not get ahead of ourselves yet.</p>
<p>IV.</p>
<p>One of the things that has not improved going from MGS1 to MGS2 is the length and density of cutscenes. I'm a big believer in the notion of letting games use their unique elements (i.e. gameplay) to tell stories and engage the player. That said, cutscenes are probably always going to be necessary in games of this scope and ambition. If you proceed through the game without any stumbling (i.e. you know what you're meant to do and do it successfully and efficiently first time), then the game might take about 8-10 hours. At least 5 of those hours are taken up by the copious amount of cutscenes and dialogue. After MGS1, nobody expected MGS2 to be light on plot, but the game dedicates an almost absurd amount of time to exposition through cutscenes.</p>
<p>The codec returns from the previous game, but since the graphics and art style have undergone a massive overhaul, the hand-sketched animated portraits of the characters have been replaced with the heads of the respective character models. It's easy to see why this choice was made and in theory allows the characters to be a lot more expressive and 'animated', however the personally I preferred the style of the previous game. Many cutscenes are animated in this way, and it's likely that this was done in order to avoid having to choreograph, animate and edit cutscenes involving the full character models - which would involve keeping the scene interesting with camera angles, body language and an interesting environment. It's a clever trick, but the devs probably should have seen it as a warning sign; if you're having to use the codec as a means of coping with the amount of cutscenes, there are probably too many cutscenes, or at least too much dialogue.</p>
<p>While I conceded that cutscenes and cinematics are probably always going to be necessary to convey certain story/plot elements, there's a lot of time wasted by needless exposition in MGS2. The conversations with Emma Emmerich are particularly egregious. Establishing who she is, that she misses her brother, she's scared of water and finally her explaining the internet to Raiden, all take place in separate cutscenes. A lot of these points could have been combined or subtly hinted at through other means rather than have the characters discuss them at length. The dialogue in MGS1 had a tendency towards over-analysis of individual conversation topics, but at least seemed to have clear conclusions. Several conversations in MGS2 are meandering and appear to just <em>end</em> with no clear denouement.</p>
