<p>I briefly mentioned in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thephilosophersmouth/photos/pb.1652760244957595.-2207520000.1445942562./1700625880171031/?type=3" target="_blank">post </a>about Baneposting contra Loss edits that Loss edits will only survive through the same postmodern adaptation as baneposts. Loss edits are a material manifestation of the conceptual art whose art-concept is to be constructed 'Loss-wise'. This perhaps applies to all narratologically conservative memes. An internet meme is the concept (the Dawkinsian 'meme')</p>
<p>I made this 'pure', conceptual meme which can be expressed as (3, 3) (6, 3) (-5,5) (-6, -3) (-4, -3) (3, -2) (6, 5) to . The conceptual art is modernism par excellence--an attempt at the purification of art into an analytic communication of speicifc information as the artist intended. The revivalism of loss edits and its adoption by meme pages and ironics alike owes not only to its normie-proof exclusivity (the very joke being that the viewer understands the reference) and exploitability; there is yet fresh, unexplored potential in the ways of the postmodern. Through the meta-ironic self critique of ironics provides the canal into which the ironic (analytic) and neo-traditionalistic (exploitable/synthetic) aspects recombine and develop towards the post-postmodern of post-ironic memes.</p>
