<p>Has anybody seen this documentary?</p>
<p>[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9t89fZ0RqEw[/embed]</p>
<p>Watched it last night. Spoiler alert, the trailer is pretty much the entire documentary.<!--more--></p>
<p>'Variety':</p>
<blockquote><p><em>"a peerless study [...] into the psychology of the internet-obsessed". </em></p></blockquote>
<p>There's something particularly amazing about a magazine nobody reads claiming a film nobody will see is a peerless study into something that is readily accessible to anybody.</p>
<p><strong>I wasn't aware that some people already considered a virtual reality as deserving more attention than 'physical reality'... except for mmorpgs I guess, but once the time comes that virtual reality is almost indistinguishable I might make the jump to calling it as 'real' as meatspace.</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this documentary is precisely to reinforce the distinction between the realities though.</p>
<p><strong>How so? Does it consider the reality of Second Life as having a 'less realness' or being 'not real'?</strong></p>
<p>It wants us to focus precisely on the reality/irreality of SL. Back up a bit, who's this film made for? Answer: non-internet addicted people. We're all meant to point and laugh at these freaks, maybe even spitball them in the back of the head like we're jocks and they're nerds.</p>
<p><strong>I don't think irreality is a word...</strong></p>
<p>Look at how the trailer is directed: Sassy black chick is hot enough to melt steel beams on SL, but in reality, she's huge. Dramatic music sting, and scene. This isn't meant as a glance into the reality of SL, it's meant to reinforce SL as *not* real, while the "real" world gets to sit back in it's self-assuredness that it is, in fact, 'real'.</p>
<p>One of the things that the film doesn't (in fact, more accurately: CANNOT) comprehend or attempt to understand is the fact that on SL, that sassy black chick is a real-estate developer. In a world where you can create anything, she tries to recreate luxury houses for avatars that are incapable of feeling warm or cold.</p>
<p>Does she think that's air that she's breathing?</p>
<p><strong>But her SL self and 'real' self <em>are</em> different, aren't they?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, but when she logs into SL, she isn't escaping into a 'fake' virtual reality to get away from the 'too real' normal reality. SL users are mostly running away from one fake reality that didn't give them what they wanted, and into a fake reality where they can attempt to recreate the first one, but with slightly more control over it's parameters.</p>
<p>Using a virtual world like SL in order to create virtual beds is like dropping acid in order to take a dump. If SL is really meant to be a fantastic dreamspace where anything is possible, then why is this woman spending her time recreating the boring world that she lives in?</p>
<p><strong>So, there's really not as much difference between SL and real life to SL users?</strong></p>
<p>Quite. The film seems to want to distance the realities of SL and 'real life' because it won't (can't) acknowledge that for most SL users, SL is actually just a reproduction of 'real life'. The reason for this distinction is not because one objectively exists, but because the documentary makers are (unwittingly) creating propaganda to reinforce the 'reality' of.... 'reality'.</p>
<p><em>"Our world is real because look at this one that definitely is not".</em></p>
<p>The couple that met on SL click buttons and make their avatars kiss... but it's totally simulated... it's not a 'real' kiss.</p>
<p><strong>Why do you say that?</strong></p>
<p>Well, it turns out both of them have real-life partners...</p>
<p><strong>Hey, be more open minded...</strong></p>
<p>I'm not judging... but I will make the observation that their partners are oblivious to the relationship that has blossomed on SL. What, they don't care about the interest that has begun to absorb most of their partners' spare time? They don't care that their partner spends 8hrs/day on the computer clicking on virtual genitals? Kind of makes me think that the 'real life' relationships are simulations too. Their real partners don't take their SL "game" seriously because they treat their own marriage as a fake "game". When that guy kisses his 'actual' wife, it's a simulation. He doesn't actually feel anything. He's copying something he saw in a movie, or the way in which he used to kiss his wife. To paraphrase Baudrillard, "it's simulacra all the way down".</p>
<p><strong>I think one point the doc is trying to make is that these people are cowards </strong><strong>and choosing an easy, virtual affair over leaving his wife doesn't exactly refute that assertion</strong></p>
<p>But right now we've fallen into the trap... we're discussing the SL users... let's spin it around: The documentary maker is a coward. He made this film in order to reinforce the reality he lives in. The reality of SL is heavily manipulated, it's all just a simulation of something and everything is a referent to some other thing. In short, SL is fake, yes, but it's fakeness is overt, obvious.</p>
<p>The real world is just as heavily manipulated, dominated by simulation and reference... it just happens in 3D HD surround-sound.</p>
<p><strong>Loads of people are cowards. Everyone is probably a coward/complacent in at least one aspect of their lives. But the doc maker made something. making a documentary however shit requires a bunch of effort, planning, skills, practise...</strong></p>
<p>SL users are pretty good at stuff in SL...</p>
<p><strong>Cooking real pasta is harder than becoming a lvl 50 cook in an MMO.</strong></p>
<p>Cooking real pasta is <em>different</em> to cooking virtual pasta... my mother doesn't even know what "Lvl 50" <em>means</em>, let alone how one becomes Lvl 50, but cooking pasta is easy for her. I mean, in that way, everything is easy once you know how.</p>
<p>The documentary is very well made, but I just think it's laughable to regard it as some kind of deep insight into the world of SL.</p>
<p>The documentary maker wanted to ask the question: "What the hell are these losers doing that would make them give up on their lives in favour of nothing at all?" but if he'd have asked that question explicitly and objectively, the cameras would have to be pointing in the opposite direction.</p>
<p><strong>So you agree with "What the hell are these losers doing that would make them give up on their lives in favour of nothing at all?" but think it shouldn't focus on second lifers/no lifers but rather typical members of society?</strong></p>
<p>The film could be read not as a study into people who retreat into virtual reality, but instead as a propaganda piece aimed at defending his OWN reality by criticising the reality of SL users. The film is well made, but it represents the doc-makers bias just in HD.</p>
<p>Pictures and movies direct our gaze and only show us what the person pointing the camera wants us to see. Their vision... their <em>version</em> is the default reality, the burden is shifted onto everybody else if we want to challenge it.</p>
