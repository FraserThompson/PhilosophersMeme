Here at The Philosopher's Meme, we appreciate the educational value of peer support. To help our students understand the course material, we turned to science.

In collaboration with Finder-Spyder Labs, Inc., we combined our students' best essays on their favourite philosophers with the students' own DNA in order to create their dream study buddy.

**First,** we forced a bot to read homework from our PHIL101: Introduction to Social and Philosophy classes (SEMESTER 1). **Then,** we asked it to make life forms based on them using the students' bodily fluids we collected. After 18 months of waiting, this is what crawled out of the incubators, teeming with lust (for knowledge!).
