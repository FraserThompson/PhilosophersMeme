<p>Maybe it's the rum, or maybe the world went crazy.</p>
<p><!--more-->Just saw a video of a dancing fat kid. The caption said: "I wish I could be as uninhibited and confident as he is: what a kid, we should get him on Ellen Degeneres!"</p>
<p>Get in the sea.</p>
<p>"How much have you had to drink?"</p>
<p>That's not the point and you know it. Come on, first principles: who do you think wrote it?</p>
<p>"Well, you never shared a link, so how do I even know it exists?"</p>
<p>It exists alright. Just humour me.<br />
I.</p>
<p>Whoever wrote that is firstly going to be painfully oblivious to a basic truth: the fact that they think a dancing and confident fat kid is remarkable is the EXACT reason why they will never feel the way he does. The two facts are actually the same fact, or at the very least they have the cause and effect backwards.</p>
<p>But worse than that, is there not, hidden in the assertion that he should go on TV, a subtle acquiescence to fact that the fat kid basically *should* feel ashamed about his fatness? After all, is it not that his refusal to feel ashamed that is remarkable in the first place? I don't think this, but do you know our caption writer doesn't?</p>
<p>II.</p>
<div>
<p>Dear caption-writer: If he doesn't feel ashamed of his body, why are you going to step in and tell him that the rest of the world disagrees? Let's imagine that your Ellen's boss and you get him on TV. Do you not think that while Ellen grins at him and tells him what a trooper he is after an entire studio audience laugh at the funny dancing fat kid (that isn't funny because he's fat, but simultaneously would be unremarkable if he weren't fat: masking an insidious truth), the thought might not enter his head that the default assumption among his peers is that fat=shame?</p>
<p>He may already think that way, or he may not.In any case, you want to reinforce that idea by praising him for not buying into it. And yet you're so aware of this notion (that 'body-otherness'=shame) that it has ruled your life to such an extent that you aren't capable of enjoying a similar kind of inhibition. By praising him, your attempting to live vicariously whilst simultaneously not sticking your head above the parapet to challenge society's preconceptions.</p>
<p>How magnanimous of you. I hope you enjoy your momentary high while you shift the coordinates of that kids reality just to confirm for yourself that you really are progressive and caring, despite the fact that your not being able or willing to enjoy the freedom he once had is the very fact that will keep him oppressed from now on.</p>
</div>
<p>III.</p>
<div>
<p>I want to make clear, it's not just the fact that the kid is being treated as a means rather than an ends in himself that I am railing against here. What really flipped the switch is that the way somebody like our caption-writer perceive culture effectively cements it as a reality. By the very act of drawing attention to something as remarkable, you make sure that it is seen as exceptional, unwittingly reinforcing the norm.</p>
<p>The logic here is so addled, that when our caption-writer saw a fat kid dancing, the only thing they were able to think about is how this plays out in the social and semiotic sphere. They are so totally trapped within the paradigm, that they reinforce it by co-opting the kid into some kind of pseudo-rebellion. "Hey, look at this kid who doesn't CARE about your standards! In fact, we're gonna MAKE him care by showing his dancing movie in front of a prime time audience!".</p>
<p>IV.</p>
<p>However, that isn't even the worst part. Note how this video is already on the internet, but the wanted to put it on Ellen?</p>
<p>It also cements the media as the arbiter of cultural hegemony. If this movie is on YouTube it's meaningless, but if we put it on Ellen then either Ellen can tell us what I all means (phew, we don't have to think!) or at the very least, the fact that's it on Ellen already tells us what we need to know about it. What does Ellen code for? Intelligent, compassionate, inclusive but above all else, Ellen holds the keys to making something into... well, a thing.</p>
<p>We consistently defer to authorities on determining not just what we're allowed to think, but what we're allowed to think about. A video of a dancing fat kid might not actually mean anything but okay it's on Ellen I'm allowed to think it means something now.</p>
<p>I'm not just picking on Ellen Degeneres, this applies to all TV shows and channels... hell, it even applies to magazines and politicians. Why should they so consistently be allowed to determine what the conversation is about. TV news brings you live to the coverage of some event... what is it? does it matter? It must do, otherwise the news cameras wouldn't be there.</p>
<p>Get in the sea.</p>
