<p><a href="https://crouchingrooster.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/daam1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-230 aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/daam1.jpg?w=300" alt="daam" width="300" height="214" /></a>From what evidence I have seen thus far, it would seem that sexuality is mostly out of the individual's control, whether it is indeed be fluid or largely consistent throughout life. The 'homosexuality is natural--and fine' argument implicitly accepts the notion that what is natural is good. While effective in its intuitive appeal to responsibility (i.e. it is wrong to blame someone for something which is not their fault, namely homosexuality), it is an argument which drastically limited in scope to the justification of what is natural.</p>
<p>For instance, relatively inclusive fundamentalist Christians often bite the bullet and respond that, "you can be attracted to people of the same sex, given that there's no choice. However, you should not have sexual relations with them--that's a choice." I personally find this argument admirable in its consistency, and I think that it highlights the limitations of the appeal to nature in the aforementioned argument.</p>
<p>There is no real inconsistency in the two progressive positions regarding sexuality if we accept that sexuality might both be fluid and 'natural' (i.e. beyond the control of the individual). Or perhaps it means it's time for us to accept that the weirdos over at Tumblr might actually have a point with their 'I-identify-as-so-and-so' schtick and that personal choice should play a more serious role in the moral status of sexual identities.</p>
<p>Let's take a step back and imagine that sexuality indeed was a choice (or at least homosexuality was a choice). Should it make a difference in the way we approach the issue? I imagine it would: but the real trouble won't be from the religious conservatives. We've already seen their worst, and it's safe to say that gay rights have been mostly secured in every area imaginable.</p>
<p>What worries me is the inevitable consequence of accepting that we can pick and choose (or at least socially reprogram ourselves to) whom we are attracted to. Does that not mean that we should sleep with 'ugly' people? Should we evenly redistribute love so that nobody is left out as a result of standards of beauty? The (apparently inevitable) conclusion for the radical left seems rather grotesque for lack of a better word.</p>
