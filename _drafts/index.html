<p>This is a list of some of the terms and concepts used in our theory of Internet Memes, briefly summarized. The philosophy of Internet Memes is still a young field of study (the subject itself being very novel), hence, new terminology appears alongside new developments. This list will be updated as the theory grows. This page is always under construction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Phylomemetic Tree</p>
<p>The Phylomemetic Tree is a diagram showing the evolution of Internet Memes from their inception as emoticons and chain e-mails through to increasingly Complex forms such as Baneposting, with a focus on the effects of their divergence into Mainstream and Underground.</p>

<p>Normie</p>
<p>An outsider to a subculture, especially Ironic memes; member of the Mainstream. Denotes those uninitiated to Underground meme culture. Associated with Pre-Ironic memes.</p>
<p>Ironics</p>
<p>An insider to a subculture, especially Ironic memes; member of the Underground. Associated with Ironic, Meta-Ironic and Post-Ironic memes.</p>
<p>Simplicity/Complexity</p>
<p>The amount of familiarity regarding the meme’s respective languaculture required to fully understand it. The simpler the meme, the fewer its layers of Irony.</p>
<p>Normalization</p>
<p>The process through which a component becomes accepted as ‘normal’ in a given culture. Commonly referred to as “becoming a meme”. Conventions which emerge organically solidify into consistent styles and take on a normative character (i.e. become grammatical rules). Both Underground and Mainstream memes develop through this process of popularization which makes an initially novel component conventional. The Mainstream exerts a much stronger pressure towards this than towards mutation.</p>
<p>Mutation</p>
<p>The process through which a meme is altered from its previous copy. It can be accidental such as in the case of misspelling or misuse, or deliberate such as in the case of Ironic memes. A primary mechanism through which memes evolve; unlike in biological evolution and natural selection, most mutations are beneficial to the meme’s survival. The Underground exerts a slightly stronger pressure towards this than towards Normalization.</p>
<p>Normification</p>
<p>(Not to be confused with Normalization.) The process through which all Complex memes constantly regress towards the Simple. As a meme becomes popular with those uninitiated to its cultural nuances, Simple mutations which only superficially obey the stylistic conventions begin to overtake more Complex pieces of the ‘same’ meme. An example is the way Ironic memes lost their initially subversive function and began to behave in much the same way as Pre-Ironic memes, thus making 'Ironic memes' a Pre-Ironic meme in itself.</p>
<p>Traditionalist memes</p>
<p>The most basic forms of Internet Memes, which are simply popular objects copied and reproduced, such as emoticons, viral videos and forwarded chain e-mails.</p>
<p>Neo-Traditionalist memes</p>
<p>Slightly complex memes that reference various Traditionalistic memes. The main source of their humor is as inside jokes.</p>
<p>Pre-Ironic memes</p>
<p>Simple memes; popular objects making up the lexicon of reference humor--what you see is what you get. They do not rely on the violation of memetic conventions for their humor. The majority of 'normie' memes fall into this category. They are highly normative and stress the importance of 'using the meme right'.</p>
<p>Proto-Ironic memes</p>
<p>Slightly complex memes that reference themes and ideas rather than other memes themselves. They differ from Neo-Traditionalist memes in that they isolate the narrative of another meme to reference. Effectively Internet inside jokes.</p>
<p>Ironic memes</p>
<p>Slightly more Complex memes; requires a prior base familiarity with some Pre-Ironic lexicon since the subversion of conventions is the primary source of its humor. Eventually begins to regress into the same behaviours as Pre-Ironic memes (see 'the decay to the meme'), which is the solidification of common practices into normative convention. This process is often referred to as 'normification' or 'normies stealing [the] memes'.</p>
<p>Meta-Ironic memes</p>
<p>Complex memes that prey on less complex memes; forms the same relationship with the meme(s) it derives its humor from as Ironic memes do with Pre-Ironic memes. They violate the structural conventions of the memes they reference,</p>
<p>They will fall into an infinite regress of successively more 'meta' memes that make fun of slightly less Ironic memes, ad infinitum unto incomprehensibility.</p>
<p>Post-Ironic memes</p>
<p>Highly Complex memes that reconcile Pre-Irony and Irony. Instead of outright violating established conventions, the narrative works with the structure in an internally consistent manner. They vary in meaning depending on whether the observer is familiar with Ironic meme culture or not, and simultaneously convey two layers of meaning. Unlike in the case of Ironic memes, it is not irony (i.e. meaning the opposite of what is being said) that is missed when the viewer lacks cultural familiarity. What you see is some of what you get--but not all. Numerous factors such as the history and associated nuance related to the stylistic choices can be taken into account to add nuance to the meme.</p>
<p>The Quadrant of Ironic Memes</p>
<p>The Quadrant is a system aimed at the practical, easily applicable classification and analysis of Internet Memes, with a focus on the inherent tension within ‘Ironic’ memes.</p>

Narratological subversion</p>
<p>Violation of conventions regarding the plot, ideas, message, or “formula” of a meme.</p>
<p>Stylistic Subversion</p>
<p>Violation of conventions regarding the visual elements, graphic structure, presentation, and manner/rhetoric of a meme.</p>
<p>Structural subversion</p>
<p>Deconstruction of the relationship between the meme and the convention of its genre through deliberate misuse (viz. a criticism of formulaic conventions in Ironic memes). What is violated is the process of normalization itself rather than any particular convention; violation of conventions regarding conventions, which is to treat rules as ‘normal’, something to be either followed (anticipated punchline) or broken (unexpected twist) for humor.</p>
<p>Meta-Ironic memes thusly bring into question the way even subversive humor becomes normalized and subject to rigid conventions--and ultimately attack the principled divide between Ironic and Pre-Ironic memes. In Post-Ironic memes, this same kind of subversion manifests as a tacit knowledge regarding nebulous conventions which emerge and overlap between different kinds of memes. Separated from narratological subversion, structural subversion can function like a play on words taking advantage of ambivalence in meaning within a meme.</p>
