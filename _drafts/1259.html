<div>An example of what a step towards more honest (and hence productive) discourse:</div>
</div>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/14/the-red-pill-reddit-modern-misogyny-manosphere-men" target="_blank">An article in the guardian explains the genesis and current culture of 'the red pill'</a>. Really refreshing to see an analysis of the 'manopshere' that doesn't immediately reach for the moral outrage and condemnation card (tempting though it may often be). Although the author clearly has no idea what 4chan is (literally or culturally), he seems to have a lot of honesty, even-handedness and hence insight when discussing TRP.</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>There are several threads to the article, but one observation is this: A lot of the bile and frustration of redpillers could easily be read as psychological damage caused by sexist media. Their expectations and experiences will never match up and they'll be saddled with feelings of inadequacy, with no outlet for that pent-up anxiety. Women have been primping and preening themselves since the beginning of time (men have too as it happens) and if you can expand your historical horizon beyond winter, you'd notice that TV, films, video games and internet pornography have not drastically altered this. Sure, the cosmetics industry is way more powerful than it used to be and pushes its products more aggressively, but this is true of almost EVERY facet of society.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>In confronting this kind of sexism, it's easy to focus on the impact on women's psyches. The media tells them they are objects, they are sexualised and they should behave accordingly. Honestly though, shouldn't we be at least equally if not more concerned with the impact on men? What happens to our young man who is told that women are objects. They're sluts. They'll do anything for basically anybody. He goes out into the world and will pretty quickly discover that none of those things are true and they won't do any of the things movies and porn said they would, at least... not for him, but maybe somebody else? The result is neurosis.</p>
<p>Surprisingly never mentioned, the objectification of women in media has strangely left a large number of <em>men</em> with self-conscious neuroses surrounding things like beard-growth, muscle-shape, body-hair, fitness, fashion etc. In a lot of cases we end up with emasculated men whose main outlets for their feelings of inadequacy are violence and masturbation. Sometimes even, violent masturbation. In severe cases our young man has two ways of coping: ask what's deficient about him that means he can't take part in the amazing ultra-sex that everybody else is enjoying, or accept that everything he's ever been told is a lie and that his entire weltanschauung is pure ideology.</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>The first one leads to depression and misogyny, the second one is clearly traumatising. As it happens, for a lot of young men, there is a third way. Take 'the red pill'. Realise that the world is not what is seems, that ideology has blinded you.... but to go in the 'other' direction (and hence maintain that women can be objects and thus can be manipulated). The redpiller accepts that he has misunderstood reality but in this concession maintains that he could theoretically be in control. Redpillers buy into the idea that women have a fundamentally different mindset to men. Much of their theories are based in evolutionary psychology and strict 'homo-economicus' transactions between individuals. For redpillers, women are out only for themselves and use sex as a bargaining chip to manipulate hapless men. For the redpiller, recognising that gives them an opportunity to play the game and 'win'. For the rest of us, the redpill mindset appears to be a perfect crystallisation of male aggression and pretensions at dominance.</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>Time to make a choice: are we going to politicise this, or are we going to be honest about it. The author of the guardian article is honest enough to admit that for all of its negative ramifications, the red pill mindset brings at least a sense of clarity and structure to the minds of its community. In effect they swap one ideology for another, but at least they feel more in control of their own actions. They find the red pill framework to be empowering. Further, he points out that for a lot of their community, TRP acts as what Foucault called a <em>Heterotopia</em>, a space parallel to our own that effectively quarantines undesirable elements by giving them an asylum separate from 'reality' in which to act out and reach their conclusion. Acknowledging all of this should not be read as an endorsement or defence of TRP, merely it is an attempt to understand it.</p>
<p>We ought observe that we only have ourselves to blame for its existence. We focus on societies impact on women to the exclusion of its impact on men. Communities like the red pill exist precisely because we have not yet developed a way of reaching out to those disaffected men. Increasingly we choose to shame and ridicule them, which is exactly the feelings that have given them such feelings of resentment in the first place.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Fourth-wave feminism has created a 'call-out and challenge' culture online that totally alienates the very people we should be trying to win over. By shaming and ridiculing redpillers, we do nothing to change their minds. For a lot of redpillers it might be too late to 'save' them, (athough even this terminology is loaded). Rather than focus on combat, is there no room for cooperation? Can we not provide young men with an alternate vision of sexuality that engenders a sense of respect for women who are in control of their own sexuality, rather than feeling threatened by it?</p>
<p>IV.</p>
<p>The real problem facing society isn't to do with self-esteem. Given the choice, nobody will pick 'unsexy' over 'sexy'. We all want to be at least somewhat attractive to others. The problem is that we shy away from having these conversations. Do we want to talk about this, or do we want to just throw everybody who disagrees/uses the wrong terminology into a rhetorical gulag?</p>
</div>
<p>The redpillers feel like they've been cheated and hurt by the world. You can laugh at them and ridicule their logic, but the one thing you cannot do is change their minds about their own emotional state. Shaming them simply serves to reinforce their mindset, i.e. that you must dominate the opposing side through semantic games and power struggles. For whatever reasons (legitimate or no), they feel that society has stacked the deck against them. That's why trying to learn how to count cards for themselves appeals to them. Our response should be to point out that human sexuality needn't be a game.</p>
<div>
<p>If I have a daughter, I'd like her to be in charge of her own sexuality, to own it. I'm not worried that she'll grow up to be a slut. I'm far more worried about her meeting some maniac who wants her to be one, or doesn't want her to be one, or wants her to be one only when....</p>
