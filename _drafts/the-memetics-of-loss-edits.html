<p>I briefly mentioned in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thephilosophersmouth/photos/a.1652774414956178.1073741828.1652760244957595/1700625880171031/?type=3&amp;permPage=1" target="_blank">post</a> about Baneposting contra Loss edits that Loss edits will only survive through the same postmodern adaptation as baneposts. Loss edits (even the most minimalistically constructed) are a material manifestation of the same singular concept of what a Loss comic is. They bare the visual essence of the original comic. The transformation of the meme into the coordinates is the exposure of the conceptual nature of its art. All Loss edits are a single meme-concept materialized in a variety of iterations. Its art-concept is to be constructed 'Loss-wise'. This perhaps applies to all <a href="http://crouchingrooster.com/2015/11/03/the-quadrant-system-for-the-categorization-of-internet-memes/" target="_blank">narratologically conservative</a> memes (preironic to ironic memes).<br />
An internet meme is a particular kind of the Dawkinsian 'meme', which is “a unit of cultural transmission”. It necessarily spreads through a secondary materialization, in that it first spreads through people and then through machines connected via the Internet. The spread of proto-ironic and ironic memes can be compared to Lamarckian evolution, in contrast to the Darwinian co-evolution of the audience-artist interaction centred process of traditionalist and pre-ironic memes. Externalist theories of memes became increasingly relevant regarding Internet memes as the culture moved from pre-irony towards irony: the memes were cybernetically spreading, their meme-concepts ideated by brains, encoded and spread through the Internet and decoded by other brains.</p>
<p>Form follows function in mechanistic design. In art and politics—and art often is nothing more than politics—function follows form. How a work of art or meme functions is limited by the medium or vector through which it is materialized and transmitted. The Loss edit is the crystalization of the political notion that there are extraneous aspects to a meme in contrast to its essence which detract from its purity.</p>
<p><a href="https://crouchingrooster.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/purified-loss.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-296 aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/purified-loss.png" alt="purified loss" width="639" height="632" /></a>Here is a 'pure', minimalist iteration of Loss which can be expressed as (3, 3) (6, 3) (-5,5) (-6, -3) (-4, -3) (3, -2) (6, 5) to demonstrate that conceptual art still relies on materiality for its full expression. The exploitables stage of the Loss edits (in which its characters were replaced with humorous substitutes) were pre-ironic, as they remained unaltered in their formalist approach as did the one-dimensional narrative of 'making fun of Loss'. The comic was always about the original versus the edits, with the initial intent of Ctrl+Alt+Delete at the outset and the punchline at the end of the meme.<br />
The transition from this pre-ironic form into ironic was the rejection of the original author's intent and the re-establishment of the seven-coordinate point, '1;11/11;1_' layout of the four panel comic as a found art object qua conceptual 'object' contra subject. All that which superficially resembles anything other than the intentionally created art object is an accident of misperception, as represented by comments from 'normies' not getting the joke.<br />
The syntactic essence of Loss edits is the seven-coordinate point formula as materialized in any given pre-ironic to ironic iteration of the meme; its semantic essence is the form of the original comic, whose ironic reiteration is the rejection of the original intent of the old author in favour of the new authors who have appropriated the original as found, conceptual art; and the pragmatic essence of Loss edits is obscurity itself, in which only those who are in on the joke are afforded the ability to understand the new authors' intended meaning. The in-joke aspect developed further, and the comment “I don't get it” itself became a meme.<br />
The abundance of exploitable components in the Flight Scene of Baneposting is an insufficient explanation for Loss edits falling behind in the progression towards post-irony, since the modernist parody approach has focused singularly on the visual aspect (as opposed to the obsessive deconstruction of the contingent, synthetic aspects in the Baneposters and their postmodernist approach) that tends towards “retinal art” which the proto-postmodernists and postmodernists so disdained. It's not that there isn't enough material to parody; it's that diversity of perspective is precisely not the point. The numerous reiterations are not the rhizomatic relativity of the postmodern, but the permissible irregularities of the sub-components making up the master narrative of Loss.<br />
<span class="_5yl5"><span>The conceptual art is postmodernism par excellence—an attempt at the purification of art into the analytic (separated from the synthetic conventions of aesthetics). Art ceases to be works (to be finished by the author) and becomes instead texts (to be read by the audience), of specific information as the artist encoded and as the audience decodes. All the ironic meme iterations of the Loss comic make up a single conceptualist artwork that is the 'Loss edit'; a text, completed by the audience's interaction with the concept by creating new iterations. The revivalism of loss edits and its adoption by meme pages and ironics alike owes not only to its exploitability and normie-proof exclusivity (the very joke being that the viewer understands the reference). There is yet unexplored potential in the ways of the postmodern; neglected by the monotony of the dominance of the four-panel, seven-coordinate formula. The meta-ironic self critique of the more recent pieces signal the opportunity for the reconciliation between its ironic and neo-traditionalistic aspects, and the development of Loss edits into a set of post-ir</span></span>onic memes of their own.</p>
