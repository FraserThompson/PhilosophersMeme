<div id="magicdomid148" class="ace-line"><span class="author-g-cih3v66ghr5fwz122zmi">The Chinese Room was an anti-artificial-intelligence thought experiment published by John Searle in 1980. Searle's idea centres around an individual locked in a room without knowing a lick of Chinese, but having in their possession a set of books with rules that transform an incoming message in Chinese characters into an outgoing one written in the same character set. </span></div>

<div id="magicdomid149" class="ace-line"><span class="author-g-cih3v66ghr5fwz122zmi">Searle argued that the individual was essentially "speaking" Chinese, by exchanging messages, without needing to understand it in any way, and compared the idea to a computer which could communicate with a person without needing any understanding of what it was saying or what was being said to it. The Chinese Room stood as a counter to the received philosophy of the Turing Test, which suggested that any machine capable of communication on-par with a human could effectively be considered sentient.</span></div>

<div id="magicdomid9" class=""></div>
<div id="magicdomid10" class=""><span class="author-g-oz122zz122zueoyisaftwe7s">According to its website introduction: "ShitpostBot 5000 is a facebook page where a picture is posted every half an hour by a bot. It randomly selects a user-submitted template, then fills it in with user-submitted source images." </span><span class="author-g-cih3v66ghr5fwz122zmi">While the sensicality of a post is mostly random, t</span><span class="author-g-oz122zz122zueoyisaftwe7s">he fact that the templates and source images are both selected for (potential or immediate) humorousness before being added to the pool means that the memes the bot produces are often seemingly intentional. Whenever this happens, the likes spike to quadruple the average and the comments section fill with speculations of human input.</span></div>
<div id="magicdomid11" class=""></div>
<div id="magicdomid132" class="ace-line"><span class="author-g-cih3v66ghr5fwz122zmi">The social interaction of the ShitpostBot 5000 </span><span class="author-g-oz122zz122zueoyisaftwe7s">deserves a comparison with</span><span class="author-g-cih3v66ghr5fwz122zmi"> Searle's Room: both receive input, templates and images for the former and messages for the latter; both produce output, in memes and replies; and both attempt to imitate human behaviour. The bot differs fundamentally from the Chinese Room in its lack of formal rules, as content is generated without regard for the template or the images selected, but the internal behaviour is difficult to compare, as Searle never explained exactly </span><span class="author-g-58y4100898jjuhx0">how the rules of the room would work with regards to variation or other conversational behaviour. </span></div>
<div id="magicdomid13" class=""></div>
<div id="magicdomid14" class=""><span class="author-g-cih3v66ghr5fwz122zmi">The comparison raises some interesting questions. Searle concludes that something more than </span><span class="author-g-58y4100898jjuhx0">digital </span><span class="author-g-cih3v66ghr5fwz122zmi">must be responsible for the mind, because it is not enough to look like you can speak - you must actually be able to do so. Likewise, when the ShitpostBot 5000 produces a well-received post, it isn't doing so in the more traditional creative process for memes; the bot is unable to care for meaning, relation, or appropriateness in its generation.</span></div>
<div id="magicdomid15" class=""></div>
<div id="magicdomid16" class=""><span class="author-g-cih3v66ghr5fwz122zmi">Does this allow the bot to produce memes at all - does it deal in social ideas, or simply apply rules that make it look like it does so? If the original post is not a meme - even when made up of meme templates and images - does it become a meme when it is liked, or shared, or perhaps at some other point in the content cycle? If you appreciate a meme believing it to be from a deliberate human source, but later find that it was the product of the bot, has something changed about the meme itself? </span></div>
<div id="magicdomid17" class=""></div>
<div id="magicdomid18" class=""><span class="author-g-cih3v66ghr5fwz122zmi">Or is the bot capable of producing memes, by virtue of its memetic inputs or otherwise, even if such memes are only socially acknowledged in the misuse - or coincidental use - of their component parts? What is it then to treat ShitpostBot 5000 itself as a meme? Does something gain value for being produced by the bot, and is that value greater for the posts which are less sensical or more so? What would happen to the content if the bot started feeding itself, since it could be considered a kind of format?</span></div>
