<p>How can one… how can you make philosophy… any philosophy, a philosophical theory, a philosophical concept… or even a single philosophical term “accessible to the common man”? What does “accessible” mean, and who is this proverbial “common man” for which we should strive to please?</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>First, let us rewind.</strong></p>
<p>Having been an ‘Apostle Paul’ style convert to philosophy many years ago, at a time when I erroneously engorged myself in the field of history and held open disdain for philosophy and more particularly the words from my philosophically inclined brother, I have come to find the following hard to swallow but manifestly true trends.</p>
<p><strong>The Trends:</strong></p>
<p>The First: Philosophy is <u>NOT</u> for everyone, and for those of which it is not something they can do, they <u>SHOULD</u> listen to those who can engage in it and not dismiss it because it sounds foreign. (Is that not just a sort of xenophobia of data?)</p>
<p>The Second: Philosophy is irreducibly complex at each level and every attempt to simplify (like the loss in sound quality one can hear when too many cables are connected together between the stereo and the device itself) results in the loss of some of its fidelity, clarity and in some cases its content. The more a philosophical term/concept/theory is converted, simplified, altered, translated or otherwise physically manifested outside of the mind of the original thinker, the more of it is lost proportionate to its steps from the source. This means that we must expect some loss of the content of the idea being told to us at every stage along which that idea had to cross to meet our minds, with the final and most “lossy” stage to be our cognizing of the idea itself into our minds. This worry of the “loss of fidelity of idea” is nothing new and was mentioned by Plato with regard to Socrates’ dislike for writing down works and ideas as he felt that there would accrue loss to the overall value of the idea.</p>
<p><strong>What am I saying in these “manifestly true trends” and what am I then not saying?</strong></p>
<p><strong>What I am saying:</strong></p>
<p>What I am saying is that “manifestly true trends” are every bit of the words I painstakingly decided on. The first word “manifestly” is to communicate to the reader that these truths are not something that I felt were self-evident, and definitely not something you need feel should be evident to you. If you are a kind soul that has the loving appreciation to think that all people are capable of the same feats, than I salute a clearly gracious outlook, but in this article you may struggle over the idea of “manifestly”, such that it is learned or revealed in time. The second word “true” cannot be separated from the word that came before it and the word that followed it. My use of the word “true” cannot and should not be taken by itself, for in being “manifestly true” it would mean that something or somethings, or some period of time came together beforehand to cause or result in something true. This manifest truth is therefore a truth very different than the truth of the idea that, say, the number “1” represents a thing, and the number “0” represents no thing, or nothing. This brings us lastly to the third word “trends”. I picked the word “trends” to reflect that by being “manifestly true” what I am reflecting upon has become or appears to have become true, but trends… oh trends…. trends is my saving caveat or word of grace. The use of the word trends at the end of “manifestly true trends” turns those three little words into something that, against the entire project of this article, can be erroneously boiled down to “The following two things I find to be true, and with good reasons, but like… you know… I can’t say they are absolutely for <strong>realisies</strong> true.”</p>
<p>(So… Is my own meta-breakdown of the meta-breakdown of the inability to convey an idea fully starting to somehow show itself?)</p>
<p><strong>What I am not saying:</strong></p>
<p>The inability to concentrate on philosophical concerns makes a person both disqualified from public discourse, and of a lesser worth.</p>
<p>After all, the worth of a person is much too heavy of a philosophical matter to be concerned with in this small pseudo-tirade.</p>
<p><strong>What then can the word “accessible” mean, if every stage of communication drains a bit of the content of the communicated idea?</strong></p>
<p>Alas, my good sailor adrift in this Metaphysical Sea of Kant’s, I will fortunately, or unfortunately for you, posit what should be considered for something to be held accessible. If it is followed that there is always some loss of fidelity of an idea whenever it is apprehended outside the original idea former’s head, then we must be at ease with the idea that all communicated ideas will suffer at least <u>SOME</u> loss of fidelity. Accordingly if we are at ease with the idea that some fidelity is always lost to us, then does the question not just become…</p>
<p><strong>“If we can’t stop a loss to fidelity, then how can we limit the amount of lost fidelity”? </strong></p>
<p>My answer: find the most direct access to the idea former’s head and learn it there… also here’s why and here’s how:</p>
<p>We should start by limiting the number of stages of separation from the idea’s source to your mind. Ideally, as in the ancient time of the forum, the apprehension of an idea is best heard orating out of the idea former’s mouth in public. One may then reasonably postulate that a recording, either visual or aural, would then suffice as the next best thing, but to that I regret to argue that is not the case. The next best way to limit the loss of an idea’s fidelity is to read about it in a published work. The apparent discord between a live appearance and a static work with recorded audio and video may seem odd but here is why live is best, published or intentional written works are next, and all the rest are less desirable.</p>
<p>In a live delivery of an idea the speaker, the one from which the idea is emanating, she/he is able to speak freely their idea to an (amenable) audience and afterwards answer questions, queries, clarifications, and critiques to points and positions that were originally mentioned by him/her. In the sort of back and forth roof tile overlapping of information any fidelity lost in the first rendition, that is the rendition of the speech or presentation, can be somewhat reduced, sort of like the defragmentation of an old hard drive. A presenter talking live in real-time can also react, clarify and attempt to provide lost fidelity through the answering of questions and comments.</p>
<p>But while one can ask of a live presenter this same ability to query or look for lost fidelity is not present in a video or sound recording of the idea’s source. While definitely such sound and video recordings deliver the human aspects of intonation and emphasis just as well as a live experience would, the lack of the follow up “defragmentation” querying period means that lost fidelity cannot be recouped. But! you still may ask, is this still not the case with published, written or prepared works? And I submit now, the answer is no, and it is no for the reason I’ve decided to type this myself…</p>
<p>When I put an emphasis on “published/intentional” I speak of the idea that the work was not some off-scribble response to a facebook post, or some text message to a friend or even some historical letter from two hundred years ago in a museum; but I am identifying a piece that was written with the sole and intent purpose that the person writing sat down to write the slab of text for the purpose of sharing it with as <strong>little misinterpretation as they could possibly think of</strong>. The intent behind a work is the deciding factor that makes it a “published piece” and it is also in this intent that we find the value of it over the value of any kind of audio or video recording. Perhaps in the time I am writing a good allegory of the feeling of “intentional writing” is best reflected at those times when someone takes thirty minutes to write a ten word text to the boy or girl they have way too much of an interest in.</p>
<p>So. The intent of a published piece should, ideally, strike the reader as being a piece of text that has been thought about, then mechanically written (perhaps written over many times) and then reviewed with the sole divine purpose of making sure that what is contained is not misapprehended as far as the writer can possibly foresee. A published work of intellectual investment comes with it the expectation that what the person wrote was under no way slapdash, insincere, or otherwise considered to be “non-canon” as fellow theological… and fantasy fans of mine would relate. I argue that a video or audio recording (lets clarify an exception to books/works on tape where they’re reading an intentional writing out loud) of a speech, radio interview, or any other happenstance possible is unable to deliver the kind of reliability of a published/intentional work and such a work is only ever second to being able to speak to the idea former in person.</p>
<p><strong>That was a fine overzealous take on modern mediums, but what is “The Common Man”?</strong></p>
<p>Well… There is no common man. Nietzsche killed our common man, and he’s been shouting about it in the marketplace ever since. To become clearer and for the sake of brevity I will merely say that I do not believe nor can I conceive any “form” of what the “common man” was. I may be ending this article with a kind of dismissive, sorry no answer, on one of my main points, but I do so to try and illustrate just how irreducibly complex philosophy is. Do me a favor, go back and read the 2<sup>nd</sup> of the <strong>“Manifestly True Trends” </strong>and tell me now, was my second point convincing, and how much fidelity have I lost in trying to explain it.</p>
