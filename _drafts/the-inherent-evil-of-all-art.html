<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>All theories of ethics must eventually amount, whether implicitly or explicitly, to a theory of politics; all theories of politics must likewise amount, implicitly or explicitly, to a theory of history. If politics is a body of ethically relevant relations between people, history is the motion through which any given polity transverses across time. In this essay I begin from the Nietzschean conception of power as the consequence of the will to power, an inherent quality of life and the motive force which drives every life form, and argue along the Foucauldian line that the expression of power is always a dyad of action and reaction between individuals within their socio-structural arrangement. Continuing from this, I argue that the immanent telos in the Nietzschean conception of power provides the Foucauldian conception of bio-political power-relations the necessary context in the form of a theory of history, required to legitimize Foucault’s dichotomy of right to death and power over life as an ethical theory and not merely a derivative, historicist ontology of power. I conclude that though it does not guarantee goodness on the socio-political level, the drive for the right to death (i.e. will to power) is inherently, emergently virtuous, while power over life (i.e. bio-power) is inherently, emergently vicious; power is not always a vice but always entails it, and the moral status of a collective is never its constituent sum.</p>
<p><strong>The Ontology of Power</strong></p>
<p>The Darwinian and Schopenhauerian theories of physiological motivation, against which Nietzsche develops the theory of the will to power, can be summarized as the will to live or survive. Through the interpretation of the history of life itself as an uninterrupted series of species-struggles, Darwin provides a foundation for a scientific, quantitative theory of history. “We can so far take a prophetic glance into futurity as to foretel [sic.] that… as natural selection works solely by and for the good of each being, all corporeal and mental endowments will tend to progress towards perfection”. The Darwinian theory of history, a linear progression from inferiority towards superiority, is the result of Darwin’s own lack of imagination in the interpretation of his theory of natural selection; a failure to appreciate the impossibility of a universally applicable inferiority (that is, the fact that no trait is ever perfect or imperfect in isolation from an environment against which its fitness may be tested).</p>
<p>The error arises from the fact that a will to merely survive must be the motive force behind any mechanism whose selective process consists of a dichotomization between survival and extinction (viz. natural selection), to which Nietzsche objects by pointing out that this will to survive evidently manifests in nature as “the inevitable domination achieved by the average, even below-average types” and not a selection for those possessing universally superior traits. This is due to Nietzsche’s own misunderstanding of the theory of evolution, which he mistakenly assumed to imply its own historical directionality. Against this particular interpretation of Darwinism, Nietzsche posits instead that “the only reality is the will to grow stronger of every centre of force—not self-preservation, but the will to appropriate, dominate, increase, grow stronger”. The will to power is the appropriation of, the domination over, the increase by and the growing stronger beyond the other: "the will to power can manifest itself only against resistances; therefore it seeks that which resists it”.</p>
<p>The will to power is the motive force behind the natural tendency of organisms to behave as such, seeking conflict to overcome and grow from. In the search of a principle from which to derive the predictive power that a meaningful theory of history requires, ‘survival of the fittest’ merely amounts to a historicist tautology: hitherto, those that were best suited to survive have survived; those that survived were evidently the best suited to survive. Unlike the will to survive, which is only hermeneutic and cannot provide predictive power to a theory of history, the will to power is a theory of telos inherent in all things, and thereby provides its resultant theory of history a component of directionality. This historical directionality, composed of the intrinsic directionality within every individual organism, is employed in the Nietzschean theory of history in much the same way that the laws of physics are applied to the study of chemistry: “should we not be permitted to assume this will as a motive cause in chemistry, too?– and in the cosmic order?”. With the will to power as the telos of history, a historical code of morality can be derived: that which progresses history forward towards perfection (viz. the creation of the Übermensch) is good; that which resists this expression of the will to power is evil.</p>
<p><strong>Good and Evil as the Will to Power and Bio-Power</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The will to power, a motive force behind all life, thus doubles as the moral dimension of the Nietzschean theory of history. Conservatism, which manifests only as resistance against the will to power, is therefore a repressive power over life itself—what Foucault refers to as bio-power: “To refrain from injuring, abusing, or exploiting one another; to equate another person’s will with our own… if we were to try to take this principle further and possibly even make it the basic principle of society, it would immediately be revealed for what it is: a will to deny life, a principle for dissolution and decline”. This denial of life is not the organismic drive to destroy and dominate life forms, but the suppression of life’s will to power through the denial of that very destructive urge which all life possesses. A slave morality, it welcomes “an enslavement of the individual” in order that “a complex of power” can be maintained. Slave morality ultimately manifests as a collectivized, normalizing, historically conservative power of society over individuals; a drive for “the right to foster life or disallow it to the point of death”. Master morality ultimately manifests as the growth of individualistic, diversifying, historically progressive power within individuals; a drive for “the right to take life or let live”. Thus bio-power is the power of slave morality over a collective of people; discipline is the political technology through which it manifests. The will to power is the progressive force of good which moves history forward towards the creation of the Übermensch, and bio-power is a conservative reaction against it, pulling instead in the direction of the Üntermensch, and therefore evil.</p>
<p>For Nietzsche, the problem of slave morality or bio-power is “the problem of ‘thou shalt’”; the socio-structurally administered fostering or disallowance of life; a conservative repression of the will to power. Slave morality makes “’improvement’ the sole duty, everything else a means to it (or a disturbance, a hindrance, danger: consequently to be combatted to the point of annihilation—)” and is motivated by “(1) the instinct of the herd against the strong and independent; (2) the instinct of the suffering and underprivileged against the fortunate; (3) the instinct of the mediocre against the exceptional”. Consider Foucault’s point that the dominance of this slave morality has led to “the functional inversion of the disciplines”, which means that “the disciplines function increasingly as techniques for making useful individuals”. Slave morality as expressed through socio-structural control of the individual by the collective consists of not domination by destruction (which would be an expression of the will to power) but a domination by care or discipline.</p>
<p><strong>Good and Evil as Action and Reaction</strong></p>
<p>“If one can apply the term bio-history to the pressures through which the movements of life and the processes of history interfere with one another, one would have to speak of bio-power to designate what brought life and its mechanisms into the realm of explicit calculations and made knowledge-power an agent of transformation of human life”. Bio-history concerns the development of the technology of social control from the implicit towards the explicit; towards the emergence of increasingly sophisticated bio-political socio-structures. It is the history of the resistant force against the will to power which has produced all of its antagonists; the ultimate expression of historical inertia. The Nietzschean theory of history is the history of will to power, to which the history of bio-power is merely a constant subcomponent; human bio-history is the history of the reaction of slave morality against which the master morality may express its will to power by the very conflict and overcoming of the obstacles which this centralizing, massifying force.</p>
<p>“Power… universally in a concentrated or diffused form, does not exist. Power exists only when it is put into action”. It is only the will to power which exists in this universal form and drives the conflict of wills which generate power in the form of struggle. “At the very heart of the power relationship, and constantly provoking it, are the recalcitrance of the will and the intransigence of freedom”. The establishment and operation of any power-relation (which is the essence of all struggle) entails resistance. The overcoming of this resistance always leads to the growth or accumulation of power: even the apparent dissipation of power, which seem to naturally follow struggle, is in fact merely the consequence of an overabundance of power; division is the result of an escape from the impotency that uniformity entails—diversification is not the dissipation of power but procreation.</p>
<p>Bio-power naturally arises as the reaction against the will to power; it is necessary for the will to power to overcome this conservative force to progress history forwards towards the Übermensch. Without bio-power, the progress of history will halt, as the will to power can only manifest its power as conflict against, domination over, triumph beyond antagonistic force. The absence of either will ultimately result in total stagnation of historical progress; extinction. Thus a genuine love of one’s enemies is said to be possible only for the strong, for only the strong recognizes antagonism as what it truly is—the sole means of progress. However, bio-power is only ever reactionary and cannot arise out of its own accord; it is ressentiment collectivized and eventually politicized, and hence derives all of its meaning and power through the rejection of the telic nature of the will to power. This asymmetry between the will to power and bio-power results in the asymmetry of their emergent moral statuses: individuals who embody all that which is good on a personal level such as love or altruism are precisely the same components which make up the massifying socio-structures which wield their bio-power over individuals and life itself.</p>
<p><strong>Good and Evil as Philosophy and Art</strong></p>
<p>As bio-power can only ever exist the reaction against the expression of the will to power, its mere existence always indicates that expression, and thus progressive struggle. That is not to say that progress is inevitable, or even that all struggle leads to progress towards the Übermensch; only that some progressive struggle exists, regardless of its magnitude. Certainly history always ‘progresses’ inasmuch as events transverse through time; whether it progresses towards the telic achievement of history through the creation of Übermenschen individuals or merely succumbs to the conservative dissipation of power through the uniformization of individuals unto the creation of an Üntermenschen species is a matter of the modality of the will to power. Thus I will conclude this essay with a discussion of the example of the contrast between the progressive against conservative expressions of power: philosophy and art. Despite following the Nietzschean theory of history, I shall radically oppose Nietzsche’s claim that art plays a life-affirming role and instead argue that art is always a conservative force which seeks to subjugate life to bio-power.</p>
<p>Art is a process of introverted unification; philosophy is a process of extraverted division and deduction. That is to say, artworks are culminations of privately assembled visions that nonetheless stem from the collective narrative of the world. Even the most ‘progressive’ art is necessarily contextualized in reflection to its social setting—at best it is reactionary, ‘counter-cultural’. Contextual purity is the privilege of the philosophers, whose arguments must necessarily be self-supporting. Each argument must be a closed system, no matter what the external socio-political, socio-structural context that may have prompted its formation: the basic structure of an argument is the reasoning and its conclusion; the basic structure of art is the artwork and its context.</p>
<p>A good philosopher need not be a good artist at all. The ‘artistic nature’ of the sciences is a plebeian myth, an implication of slave morality and its demand for egalitarianism of values. It is nothing other than the result of a deliberate obfuscation of terms, an expansion of the jurisdiction of ‘art’ until virtually no endeavour or achievement is undeserving of being referred to as ‘artistic’, thereby democratizing the honourable title of ‘artist’—a vengeful attack on the Nietzschean ideal of aristocracy which shuns the mediocre. On the other hand, a good artist must always rely on good philosophy (though not necessarily the artist’s own). Good art (not artist) is only ever the representation of some philosophy; it is literally re-presentation. Thus we see the same asymmetry as the one between the will to power and bio-power: a poor philosopher is still a useful philosopher and therefore genuinely a philosopher (one may still employ a bad philosopher for simpler calculations); a poor artist is in fact not an artist at all, but merely a decorative technician who cannot even internalize and culminate philosophy into artwork. Mediocrity in philosophy manifests as slowness of calculations but the same in art becomes decoration, a matter of shallow handicraft.</p>
<p>All of art is thus a symptom of the collective urge for bio-political control, an expression of bio-power’s tendency towards the reinforcement of normality. At the personal, individual level art is a force of ‘good’: it is an expression of an individual’s will to power and the spiritual overcoming of oneself. However, art is a historical evil, just like martyrdom, peacefulness or altruism. Likewise, all that which is good on the historical level is frequently ‘evil’ in its interpersonal expression (though not in its intrapersonal process, which is merely the expression of the will to power at the individual level) as it necessarily entails conflict whether internal or external. All that is good and kind on the level of individuals must be a conservative force which prohibits historical progress towards the Übermensch, tending instead towards an isolated, Üntermenschen equilibria; this is due to the fact that the process of art-making is a self-referential expression of the collectivized slave morality culminated through the people’s hero, the artist. The artist must serve the shamanic function of channelling the external context through the process of artmaking and re-contextualize society. The essence of art is the drive for magnificence, which necessitates audience, the socio-structural context through which the very socio-culture re-contextualizes itself and thus reinforces normality over individuals.</p>
<p>Art thus provides philosophy (which is the culmination of master morality and progresses only in opposition against slave morality) the antagonism necessary to manifest its will to power and propel humanity towards the historical telos of the Übermensch. Without art philosophy cannot manifest its will to power. That is to say, philosophy is a force of progress towards an increase of freedom, an escape from the metaphysical bondage of socio-structural normality reinforced by bio-power. If the artistic drive were to dominate history completely, we would evolve into Üntermensch; if the philosophical drive were to dominate completely, history would cease to progress altogether in this regard; only through the antagonistic relationship between philosophy and art do we progress in history.</p>
<p>Thus the sign of a poor artist: to obsess over the conclusion and neglect the reasoning. The sign of a great philosopher is its inversion, to obsess over the reasoning and merely acknowledge the conclusion in passing. The sign of a great artist? To have overcome reasoning itself; thus becoming the channel through which the reasoning may release itself into the world in the form of a magnificent conclusion. Art is villainy; great artists are great insofar as they provide humanity with the obstacles worthy of their telos, thus establishing the directionality from inferiority towards superiority. Nietzsche was correct in his understanding that the artist-tyrant must transcend beyond the notions of good and evil; he was mistaken in thinking that the individual himself becomes transcendental as the result of this freedom from notions of morality. The artist remains historical evil incarnate, in opposition to the philosopher, despite his transcendence of such notions about good and evil.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Recall the Nietzschean theory of history discussed earlier. First consider its ontology of the mechanisms which determine the rate and direction of historical progress. The will to power is the motive force behind historical progress and indeed all things. It manifests as the drive to dominate and overcome, and imbues every organism with the same metaphysical directionality towards progress. This directionality is the urge of the individual organism to manifest its will against its environment. Now consider Foucault’s bio-power: the directionality of power is inverted in this modality, and manifests as the urge of the collective socio-structural environment to impose its normalizing influence over the individuals. Biopower, the massified re-action of the inferior against the individuated action of the superior, resembles the self-referential, self-contextualizing structure of a philosophical argument. Though its genesis is the result of the historically progressive expression of the will to power, the reverse is untrue—the bio-political force of conservatism itself generates no active pressure towards historical progress, for progressive force is never reactive but only proactive; bio-power provides only the means to progress if the progressive force is powerful enough to overcome its antagonism. Evil always accompanies goodness; power always entails some vice; even in the lowest depths of history’s abyss, there will still be art.</p>
