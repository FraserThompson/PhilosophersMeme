<p>If you're a leftist, chances are you've never read Rand- fair enough. There's only so many books you can read every year and an author as notorious as Ayn Rand hardly qualifies for top of the list reading. Here's something that you won't often hear from other leftists: she is basically Nietzsche with artistic heroes replaced with all 'producers of value', refusing great artists the special snowflake status of the proto-ubermensch (just one more reason for artsy types to hate her).</p>
<p>Ayn Rand's politics is fantastic bullshit- but as a psychological philosopher she is spot on with her analysis of the neuroses brought on by the combination of what the Marxists call 'rentier capitalism' and what Nietzsche calls "slave morality" (although she would have denied this). It’s an exploration of self-completion through work: a secular Protestant ethic (though Rand would have denied also that capitalism is an expression of this Protestant ethic) if you will, which often results in the conflation of her position with conservatism.</p>
<p>I like to think of the classic left-right political spectrum as one ranging from optimism to pessimism about human nature: the socialist psychologists regarding the human mind as an initial blank slate which could be freely remolded; the free market capitalists' belief that greed is though irrational, a good thing that should be groomed and promoted; the conservative belief that human nature dominates human life and it ought to be disciplined and controlled.</p>
<p>Rand's work is the apotheosis of this capitalist optimism about human nature, which differs from the optimism about nurture not only in what is celebrated or its political conclusion (away from collectivism), but most importantly the psychology of the heroic individual. It’s a more humanistic counterpart to the Nietzschean hero, despite the artistic nature of the latter outshining the workaholic soullessness of the former in the competition for seeming humanness. It’s a celebration of what ‘can be’, as opposed to what ‘could be’: the celebration of human potential as individuals rather than as a species. It’s a glimpse into a glorified yet nonetheless humanized image of the classic liberal- and for that much, she deserves a readership from the left.</p>
