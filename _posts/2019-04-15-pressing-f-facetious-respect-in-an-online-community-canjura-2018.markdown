Julian Canjura, creator of the linguistics-themed meme group <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1077001935778165">Linguistics ['ʃɪt̚.,pʰʌ̈̈ʊ̈̈.stɪ̃̃ŋ]</a>, has written a sociolinguistics <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squib_(writing)">squib</a> titled <i>Pressing F: Facetious Respect in an Online Community</i>.

Excerpt:

<blockquote>Press F for Respect (hereby referred to as Press F or f) is an internet meme originating from the 2014 videogame <i>Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare</i>. Towards the beginning of the videogame, the player’s character attends the funeral of his best friend. While at the funeral and facing the casket, the player is prompted with “Press F to Pay Respects” to his fallen friend.  Following the release, the prompt was mocked by several notable online figures and celebrities for being a poor and trivial way of dealing with what is typically very serious and emotional in real life.  Since 2014, online users on various social media platforms have pressed f in threads, either by asking other users to press f or by commenting “f.” This paper will investigate pressing f by developing a formalized speech act schema for pressing f that also accounts for its connection to the social identity of a given speech community. To do this, we will examine the use of f in the Facebook group Linguistics ['ʃɪt̚.,pʰʌ̈̈ʊ̈̈.stɪ̃̃ŋ] (Shitposting, referred to as LS). This paper is in three parts. First, pressing f will be looked at from a theoretical framework using the formalized speech act theories of Austin (1975) and Bach & Harnish (1979), from which a formalized schema for pressing f will be proposed. Second, a survey completed by 124 members of LS regarding their perceptions of pressing f’s meaning and use will be presented. Finally, data pulled from LS will be examined, consisting of posts where the original poster (OP) asks commenters to “Press F” and posts where commenters pressed f without a prompt from OP.</blockquote>
