excerpt: <p>Pictured in Figure 2 is a meme found on 4chan that mocks the very nature of meme culture, wherein the jokes are continually remixed and reposted to the point of ‘flogging a dead horse’. In this way, the meme can perhaps be seen as a return to traditional communication modes whereby narrative, consistency and certainty are characteristic.</p>

<p>Pictured in Figure 2 is a meme found on 4chan that mocks the very nature of meme culture, wherein the jokes are continually remixed and reposted to the point of ‘flogging a dead horse’. In this way, the meme can perhaps be seen as a return to traditional communication modes whereby narrative, consistency and certainty are characteristic. Succinctly summarised by Knuttila (2011), the anonymous culture and interface of 4chan work “together to form contingency, which in turn, cascades into discourse and streams back towards the user, reflecting a unique, virtual ontological experience”. The meme can be seen as a slang language within the linguistic culture of the Internet within participatory culture.The inquisitive nature of internet memes could be likened to the postmodern method of deconstruction, in that memes frequently question the meanings of popular culture artefacts. Memes also represent the playful ironic self awareness that is prototypical of postmodern culture.</p>
