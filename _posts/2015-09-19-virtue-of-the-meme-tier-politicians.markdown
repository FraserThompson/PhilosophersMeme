I'm particularly happy to see the issue of universal health care and the Older Americans Act being highlighted. The variance of public opinion depending on variance of polling methods suggests that a lot of people don't have decisive understandings yet.</p>
<p>Sanders and Trump<span class="text_exposed_show"> provide focal points for the debate of such issues through their charming, populist personas. Basically, they're memes: their relationship manifest in the Pepe-Wojak dynamic of the cynic and the naive, and the celebration of the former predominantly consists of a humorous and ironic reaction to the monotony of the latter's earnestness. It's no wonder they are so popular on the internet.</span></p>
<div class="text_exposed_show">
<p>This dynamic is something we see replicated everywhere. For instance, the polarization regarding many important social and economic issues, which I don't think is resolvable. Ideological diversity is partly natural (sorry strong constructivists, your case is weak) and partly essential to large political systems. It's as much the result of philosophical diversity as it is the result of psychological variance both inherent and demographically determined.</p>
<p>However, I'm not uniformly pessimistic. People tend to agree on most of the less sensational issues and there's plenty else to be optimistic about: people are becoming measurably smarter (rising IQ and education level), more civil (declining violence), consistent (rising value sorting). It's almost as if unity is just within reach if only we'd listen to one another. It's the optimism regarding universal brotherhood and so on that's become a corny cliche.</p>
<p>The favoured attitude of isolating and demanding total surrender from the opposition is nonsensical. What we need is to become more comfortable with the existence of those we violently disagree with. If you're a liberal, make some conservative friends. If you're a conservative, make some friends. Liberals outnumber conservatives in uni by like tenfold. Stop trying to 'convert' people onto your side. Turning everyone lukewarm is not a good idea, but political diversity can work. It's certainly stood the test of time, to the conservatives' credit.</p>
<p>While there are issues irresolvable through anything but compromise, there are also issues irresolvable through anything other than conflict. Politics is something that should be informed by philosophy, which will fail to thrive when we safeguard ourselves from challenging opinions. We should argue more--at least then we'd be within hearing range of one another.</p>
