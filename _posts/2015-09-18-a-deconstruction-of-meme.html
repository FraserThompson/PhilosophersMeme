<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman, serif;">The fundamental essence of a meme is so grotesque in its purity of dankness that, only enveloped in numerous layers of irony does it become palatable; even then its consumption largely consists of repressing the disgust that lurks behind every doot (hence we must thank the hungry skeleton). Weak sauce merely situated alongside dank memes is recontextualized to the extent that it is decontextualized from the normies, thereby bringing into perspective the inherently <i>non licet</i> nature of all weak sauce (always as a totality, in its conceptual inseparability from memetic normativity)—its immanent dankness. This metaphysical disparity between form and function manifests, ironically, as the asymmetry in the dyad expressions of dank and irony in both post-ironic and ironic memes alike. The essence of ironically unironic memes (namely, post-ironic memes) thereby presents as the mere deductive process of decontextualization rather than recontextualization. </span></p>

<p><a name="_GoBack"></a><span style="font-family:Times New Roman, serif;">Then, what is the essential gr8ness of the meme that is rated an 8/8 by your m8? It is the superficiality of the weak sauce, situated between between the narrow ideological confines of the top text and the bottom text, bearing closer resemblance to reality than the sauce or the text alone. Here, this resemblance should serve us as a reminder of the pre-existent ideological underpinnings of reality itself which had hitherto remained only self-referential. Not only does the niceness of a meme indicate the precise degreee to which it embodies the normie, it simultaneously offers us with a glimpse of the post-post-ironic dankness which a dank meme must approach without convergence following a path of infinitely regressive decontextualization and recontextualization (i.e. ree-contextualization). </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Times New Roman, serif;">The Pepe is a mere superimposition of irony over the Wojak, but the former occupies a context so radically differentiated from the former that their functional similarity would seem even paradoxical. The contrast between Pepe and Wojak is the contrast between pity and compassion. The former manifests as an act of explicit recontextualization, a destructive reinvention of the latter in all but the symbolic identity through which the two may be distinguished, this distinction being ironic even then. Thus the very “ree-” which heralds the rejection (or perhaps the memetic ejection) of normies must be seen for what it truly signifies—an ironic call for the self-referential decontextualization of memes from dankness itself.</span></p>
