<p>Usually the popular phrase "gender is a social construct" doesn't do much in ways of resolving an argument about whether a biologically male transgender really is a woman and so on. It's used as more of a catchy summary of a position than an argument. Well, so gender is a social construct. So what? The usual implication is that since gender is 'made up', it must be possible to forgo it altogether, is inherently baseless as a concept or even morally reprehensible. Unfortunately there is no reason that social phenomena and constructions must be malleable or not at least partially predetermined, since society and the individual itself is ultimately a biological construct, all brains being organs (soft essentialism/constructionism is a much more plausible theory than hard constructionism or hard essentialism). Nor is it clear as to why socially constructed (are not all concepts as such?) concepts must be baseless or wrong. The last, equating the unnatural with immoral, is an oddly conservative fallacy which adds to the tension between radical feminism and transgenderism.</p>
<p>Perhaps the easiest way to make sense of the confusion in identity politics about various 'acceptance' movements is to think of it in three parts: biology, culture and identity. Let's look at it with transgenderism as an example.</p>
<p>1.</p>
<p>The difference between culture and identity is an important distinction. You can't make the problem go away by waving your yellow flag with a snake on it and saying "say no to big government and mind your own business", because identity politics is not just about individual freedom (hence 'politics'). Generally what entails freedom to identify as such is the demand for the positive freedom to 'live as such' (e.g. gender reassignment surgery). If someone wants to identify as trans, queer or whatever else they want, it's only consistent for someone who puts personal freedom first to see it as permissible. If you value personal freedom, you value the right for someone to think and do as they please insofar as it doesn't violate others' freedoms. The problem is, people want to be treated like what they identify as. That's a big part of identity. This obviously involves other people and is no longer just about individual choice. Weren't we just saying you don't get to tell other people what to think?</p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>Cultural identity could be split into four parts: 1) the life-history of the individual (personal experience); 2) external factors, including lineage (e.g. skin colour, family history, place of birth); 3) others' perception of the individual (e.g. acceptance by other group members, hostility from out-group individuals); and 4) the individual's self-identity in relation to the group.</p>
<p>Thus culture is about shared traits, values and experience, both biological and social. If you were born male and come to identify as a woman later on, you are part of a different culture (or a subculture within the same culture as that of women) compared to both the average man and the woman by virtue of that varied experience. That's why the existence of LGBT culture is not contradictory to their call to be treated 'just like everybody else'- there is the tacit understanding that cultural diversity is not some kind of discrimination intrinsic to societies. Since it's not only the individual's self-identity which</p>
<p>If you ignore this and think people should 'just' accept others for what they are (whatever that means), you are saying that certain people get to impose their own cultures onto others'.</p>
<p>3.</p>
<p>What people think of others is their own choice. We can argue about it (and we rightly should). But to think we ought to force certain perspectives onto people by way of social pressure (or worse, legal) makes you self-contradictory to say the least.<br />
Cultural identity is a social construct; you can identify with whichever you want, whether you want to change your nationality or gender. What you don't get to do is tell other people to 'adopt' you into their culture. You identifying with a certain culture doesn't magically make room for you in that culture, because culture itself is a social reality separate from your own cognitive reality. That's their choice, just like identifying with it was yours. Would it be bigoted of them to refuse? Perhaps. Would it harm your case from freedom to try and prevent that? Most probably.</p>
