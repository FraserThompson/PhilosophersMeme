excerpt: <p>"those aware of the history continued to use Pepe with merely a different pretence or context. What was once an expression of humour damaged through the banality of worldwide recognition is now an emblem of its own death. Pepe is being flaunted around the Internet as a corpse, symbolically to reproach normies or merely as the representation of death where the context fits. Furthermore, the explication for his justification becomes more difficult, as Pepe becoming ironically dead is often confused with people declaring that he is still dying.What we are witnessing is a real life ghost haunting the Internet. A fully functional joke, transformed into a state not living and not dead, Pepe is the first meme to suffer from the Cotard delusion."</p>
