## **Historical Alliteration Meme Pages**

HAMPs flourished/rose to prominence as a community in early 2015, some individual pages are still going strong but overall not as active as a community as they were in their heyday. They primarily post edgy ironic content on historical/political/cultural themes, and also interact/roleplay with each other or even do attacks/raids(often based on historical antagonisms/alliances, but sometimes it’s just random people getting into flamewars). Pages typically follow an alliterative naming scheme: “Adjective(s) Country-Name Memes”.
