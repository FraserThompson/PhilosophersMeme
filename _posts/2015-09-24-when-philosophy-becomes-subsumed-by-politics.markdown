<p>Oh look, a <a href="http://jezebel.com/dalai-lama-a-female-dalai-lama-must-be-attractive-oth-1732350732" target="_blank">Jezebel article attacking the Dalai Lama...</a></p>
<p>Get the rum again.... yeah, the spiced stuff, no time for mixers we're taking it neat.<!--more--></p>
<p>Jezebel, despite having the moral high ground and being staffed entirely by people who get a paycheck for writing about this kind of thing manage to completely avoid ever making anything like a cogent point in this entire article. I know, I read it.</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>What we are treated to it an opening paragraph that tells us what we're meant to think (they use airquotes in order to signal contempt for what he's said). Well, it's not so bad to frame the article with some editorialising... besides, presumably we'll get to a thorough deconstruction after it's been established what exactly he said. Can't wait! SO what exactly did he say?</p>
<blockquote><p><em>"Today in a more troubled world, I think females should take more important roles, and then I told that reporter, if a female Dalai Lama comes, their face should be very attractive."</em></p></blockquote>
<p>followed by</p>
<blockquote><p><em>"if female Dalai Lama come, then that female must be very attractive, otherwise not much use."</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Hmm, unexpected point. Let's begin the analysis, what nuances are potentially present and how might we go about responding?</p>
<p>Except that deconstruction never comes. The article quotes from an interview given to the BBC, and then... nothing. We are treated to a few more soundbites that corroborate what a colossal prick the Dalai Lama is supposed to be, but otherwise nothing. Jezebel throws down their untheorised tract and concludes with the journalistic equivalent of an exasperated glance and a "nuff said".</p>
<p>Outstanding work.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>For those of you keeping track at home, this is exactly what infuriates Jezebel's critics and more generally, what angers so many people about this brand of internet-feminism. What Jezebel attempt to do here is make it axiomatic that the Dalai Lama is wrong and then, working from within that framework, proceed to harrumph and tut from the sidelines as though this forms a substantial point.</p>
<p>At no point does the author actually articulate <em>why </em>they think the Dalai Lama (or more specifically, his statement) is wrong. I read the entire article (and way more of the comments than I should have done, although we'll get to that later) and nowhere did I see an actual response or attempted analysis of his point, let alone a rebuttal or deconstruction.</p>
<p>All of this leads me to suspect that the author of the article, the commenters (and in fact most of Jezebel's staff) don't actually know <em>why</em> it's wrong. They only know <em>that it sounds wrong</em>, and that he's not allowed to say or think this kind of thing. The fact that they appear to tread very lightly around the head of the Tibetan buddhist institution leads me to further presume that nobody at Jezebel knows enough about Buddhism to decide whether they want to pick this fight. It's almost like they don't know whether the Dalai Lama could potentially be on 'their side' with other issues, and so don't want to fully burn their bridges with outright condemnation. It smacks of politics.</p>
<p>The article is mercifully short, but it still attempts to serve a purpose, still attempts to make a point. The point is largely reinforcement of their dearly-held ideology against something that sounds spooky and scary. What's shocking is the extent to which Jezebel achieves the making of that point through subtext and the use of airquotes. Not shocking that they <em>do</em> this, but shocking that they even <em>try</em> to do it.</p>
<p>Did you bring the rum yet? Goddamnit.</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>Jezebel writers are paid to write about this kind of thing, and so presumably paid to think about it for more than 15 seconds. Their entire mandate is supposed to be offering a critical perspective on these kind of news stories. Or, to borrow the words of <a href="http://jezebel.com/262130/the-five-great-lies-of-womens-magazines" target="_blank">their own manifesto</a>, that they</p>
<blockquote><p><em>"will attempt to take all the essentially meaningless but sweet stuff directed our way and give it a little more meaning, while taking more the serious stuff and making it more fun, or more personal, or at the very least the subject of our highly sophisticated brand of sex joke. Basically, we wanted to make the sort of women's magazine we'd want to read."</em></p></blockquote>
<p>But how is this article meaningful or funny? It's basically sophistry. The whole article uses thinly veiled rhetorical tricks to drone out what they already believe to people who already believe it. This article will convince nobody who wasn't already convinced. The comments are to my point: at time of writing, the top three comments are</p>
<blockquote><p><em>"All major religions are fucked up patriarchies! Just a reminder."</em></p>
<p><em>"Yeah, but a LOT of people think of Buddhism as an enlightened exception. This is a reminder that it really isn’t."</em></p>
<p><em>"You’d think that someone who’s all about learning and enlightenment he’d have figured a few things out, but..."</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Where that last one has a gif of Timone from the Lion King saying 'nope'.</p>
<p>Fantastic. It appears all of the regular readers agree with the unspoken point. However, for us dummies who aren't as highly evolved as you beings of pure internet vituousness... does anybody mind explaining exactly what's wrong here? Any takers?</p>
<p>Nobody. Nobody actually knows why they think any of the opinions expressed in the comments section, but to avoid detection they throw out deliberate misreadings/extrapolations of what was actually said so that they can easily knock down the argument and then drop the mic whilst their own side cheers rabidly from the stalls.</p>
<p>It's typical of so much debate on the internet... strawman and appeal to authority. Those don't necessary invalidate the argument, but when all arguments consist solely of those techniques...</p>
<p>This is why we needed the rum.</p>
<p>IV.</p>
<p>To be fair, there is one comment that attempts some deconstruction of the Dalai Lama's statements, but he's on a hiding to nothing: you're in the church now, sing along with the hymn or prepare to be drowned out. Again, for those of you keeping score at home, try actually thinking about what the Lama might mean and attempting an analysis. Remember, he's spent his entire life thinking about his position: he may well have thought about things that you might not have considered in the time between putting your latte down and beginning to furiously mash your opinions into the keyboard.</p>
<p>V.</p>
<p>The entire rhetorical ethos of the article and comments just serves as an example of the criticism often levelled at internet-feminists: they don't really engage in dialectic, they insist that their opponents must clarify, hedge, explain and shuffle (whilst mocking such behaviour by dubbing it '<a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/mansplaining" target="_blank">mansplaining</a>', which seems contrary to the goals of communication and mutual understanding...) whilst they are allowed (in their own heads) to axiomatise the righteousness of their position and the wrongfulness of their opponents, declaring triumph or at the very least being able to retreat <em>knowing </em>that they were right all along, even if they were unable to convince anybody.</p>
<p>VI.</p>
<p>It is probably not necessary but totally worth mentioning that the only reason Jezebel or anybody else would care about this is because it's the Dalai Lama saying it. When what's said seems to matter less than who's saying it, that's your cue to run, and don't look back.</p>
<p>VII.</p>
<p>The Dalai Lama has a point (although as alluded to earlier, that's left as an exercise to the reader) but analysis of his point or any attempt at dialectic is totally subordinated to pre-existing political notions.</p>
<p>Politics and philosophy have been completely conflated, and rather than parse apart a complicated world by offering a fresh or novel perspective, sites like Jezebel are contributing to the problem by actively providing and promulgating a framework that seeks to shut-down debate rather than foster it.</p>
<p>The war currently being fought (albeit without any major battles... war has changed) is not between various ideologies, but between philosophers and ideologues. Debate and disagreement have become unsavoury party guests and now political ideologues from both sides of the spectrum would rather deny that debate or disagreement could/should exist in their visions of healthy societies. Both sides operate from a position of apodeictic ideology and then rather than actually proceed with analysis, claim disagreement itself is their opponent.</p>
<p>I don't doubt that the writers at Jezebel (and others) want the world to be a better place, but proceeding to perform within the space of pure ideology; pretending to be unbiased by sounding factual but biasedly telling us what to think with their opening/framing paragraph, veiling their message in subtext through airquotes and most sadly of all; being very delicate around their subject of criticism in case he comes in handy as an authority figure to appeal to at a later date... the whole thing is politics masquerading as bitesize-philosophy for the oh-so-progressive Twitterati and chums...</p>
<p>The effect of it all is to result in a destruction of the communicative and dialectical grounds that proper progress could be founded on by making opponents feel embittered and lacking recourse to open discussion.</p>
<p>Goddamnit where's that rum?</p>
