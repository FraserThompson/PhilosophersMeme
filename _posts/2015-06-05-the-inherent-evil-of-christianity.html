excerpt: Did Shakespeare believe Christianity promotes evil and tyranny-- or even
  that it is evil and tyrannical itself?
---
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Machiavelli’s The Prince is usually interpreted as the manual to an unchristian interpretation of politics. It advises rulers against the unpragmatic moralization of politics in a realpolitik approach to gaining and maintaining rule; with the Machiavellian Kings, the nobility of the ends is never a guarantee of the same for the means in politics. Meanwhile, Shakespeare’s Henry V presents an apparent victory of the moral and righteous Christian King when King Henry enters a war with France in order to secure his rightful place as king. In this short essay I will argue that Henry V is a celebration of a Christian King’s Machiavellian approach to war, justice and politics, and that the Christian worldview itself is a celebration of a Machiavellian hierarchy in which both sin and power are concentrated in the hands of those preordained for it by Divine design.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Christian Hamartiology</strong></p>
<p>According to Thomas Aquinas, evil is the absence of some particular good, a disruption in the preordained order: “something is said to be evil through its escaping from the order of some particular good” (Page 2217). Evil is a spiritual illness of an act which lacks a certain necessary goodness preordained by god; sin is thus deviation from a preordained historic, socio-political order by an individual—all sin is rebellion against the preordained order of nature.</p>
<p>It is the natural state of things that God should have immediate dominion over all of the world but kings should rule through his followers. “That an earthly king should have ministers to execute his laws is sign not only of his being imperfect, but also of his dignity; because by the ordering of ministers the kingly power is brought into greater evidence” (Aquinas, Page 2215). And King Henry V is one such ordinary king that rules his country through his people. This distinction between God and kings is paralleled by the distinction between king and men: King Henry V is repeatedly portrayed in the play as being connected to the common people such as his soldiers. At one point, disguised as a common soldier, he gives an impressive argument against the rigidity of the preordained hierarchy. “The king is but a man, as I am: the violet smells to him as it doth to me: the element shows to him as it doth to me; all his senses have but human conditions: his ceremonies laid by, in his nakedness he appears but a man; and though his affections are higher mounted than ours, yet, when they stoop, they stoop with the like wing… I could not die any where so contented as in the king's company; his cause being just and his quarrel honourable.” (H5, IV.i.3).</p>
<p>King Henry’s argument is about the equality of man before God; men ought to fight alongside men under a just cause, and under that cause they are equal. The angry response from the common soldier Williams to King Henry in disguise is a concise summary of the particular theme of the relationship between the Divine will of God and a king’s earthly rule. “But if the cause be not good, the king himself hath a heavy reckoning to make… now, if these men do not die well, it will be a black matter for the king that led them to it; whom to disobey were against all proportion of subjection” (ibid.). The response is the rejection of King Henry’s well-meaning gesture of camaraderie; Williams recognizes the gesture instead as the renunciation of responsibility it is. The “earthly king” rules as an extension of the authority of God; the earthly subjects are thereby ruled not merely through their obedience to a king but also to God, who rules all things directly by preordinance of Divine cause (Aquinas, Page 2218).</p>
<p>Thus the Machiavellian tenet that “a prince ought to have two fears, one from within, on account of his subjects, the other from without, on account of external powers” (Machiavelli, XIX) is not so incongruous with a Christian King’s rule, his “divinely appointed end” (Aquinas, Page 2218) being no different from any other man in relation to God but his earthly role necessitating the Machiavellian approach which must put ‘the end before the means’. Since “something is said to be evil through its escaping from the order of some particular good” (ibid. Page 2217), we may well say that through his mere Christian conviction, King Henry’s cause for war is justified in the Divine order which he serves, regardless of the terrible casualties and suffering which he brings upon both his men and the French. The conscious decision by King Henry to lead his men into war is no accidental “privation of good”, but rather serves to honour justice despite the bloodshed (Augustine, Ch. 11).</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Machiavellianism of Christianity</strong></p>
<p>It is telling that Machiavelli’s ideal role model for a prince should also be the prophet and deliverer of Israelites. Machiavelli and Moses’ parting messages constantly overlap, the most relevant to the subject being the total annihilation of the enemy: <sup>“</sup>smite through the loins of them that rise against [the Lord], and of them that hate him, that they rise not again” (DEUT 33:11), tells Moses the children of Israel before his death. Consider Machiavelli’s famous dictum: “men ought either to be well treated or crushed, because they can avenge themselves of lighter injuries, of more serious ones they cannot” (Machiavelli, III).</p>
<p>The advice, whether Machiavellian or Christian, is to crush the enemies of the cause. And should the cause be just, all means are justified in the light, for God governs all things directly and thus all things which are possible must be His will; “[nothing] could happen entirely outside the order of Divine government” (Aquinas, Page 2217). Therefore, all things in service of a Divine cause are not only implicitly permitted through the evidence of their mere physical possibility but immediately governed by God. The Christian world view is that of transcendental hierarchies of one ruling over the many. God over kings; king over men; man over beasts. It is the triumph of the good minority over the lesser majority; the dominion over the latter by the former is justified by the natural tendency towards the dynamic, an evidence of God’s general providence.</p>
<p>Therefore insofar as King Henry is in accord with the upholding of this general will of God, his war as a righteous claim over his place as king of the parts of France he invades—and as in accord with King Henry’s cause, his subjects’ acts also—is justified entirely. The criticism of Machiavellianism as unchristian is only sensible when the cause is unjust; the philosophy is not an ethical one in the first place but a science of politics. And what works is what is just, when the end is the glory of God. This, much like the position of king as opposed to the common soldier as we saw in King Henry’s exchange with Williams earlier, entails responsibilities. Earlier in the play King Henry uncovers a plot to have him murdered, and despite the fact that his old friends were involved in the conspiracy, he must order their execution. The Lord’s name is invoked in both the side of the accuser and the defence; the conspirators beg for mercy both from King and God, while King Henry takes the event as a special providence and another sign of the righteousness of his war (H5, II.ii).</p>
<p>It is just as well that the previous scene had ended with Pistol and Nym implying that King Henry was the cause of Falstaff’s death (H5, II.i). A king, being the minister of the Divine will (but not to God, as he rules directly and not through any subjects) and executor of the preordained order of society, not only must justify the way of death for his subjects but also leads them to a particular way of death by the mere act of ruling. A king is both the living justification and cause of war; he is a medium through which the Divine order is channelled, and thus a disruptive and rebellious force such as Falstaff cannot bear to be near it. Hierarchization is the essential basis of the Christian morality, and thus we see King Henry establish and maintain order at all cost throughout the play, his justifications enveloped in the pious language of worship but nonetheless adhering to Machiavelli’s cold logic for the security and maintenance of kingship.</p>
<p>When he meets King Henry for the second time, Williams denies culpability for his earlier insolence when King Henry came to him in disguise. “Your majesty came not like yourself. You appeared to me but as a common man -- witness the night, your garments, your lowliness -- and what your highness suffered under that shape, I beseech you take it for your own fault and not mine, for had you been as I took you for, I made no offense. Therefore I beseech your highness pardon me” (H5, IV.viii). Is not Williams’ defence a complete surrender to a king, in this acknowledgement of his base position as a common soldier? It would not be far-fetched to evoke a comparison between King Henry and Jesus, who had to absolve all sin done unto himself by the people who failed to recognize his spiritual kingship for his human visage.</p>
<p><strong>God, the Henchman of Kings and Prophets</strong></p>
<p>Christianity is the religion of absolution; in other words, it presupposes sin to be absolved. Besides original sin, which makes up the backbone of Christianity’s hamartiological genealogy, passed down hitherto without interruption from the very first man, there is also presupposed a more common and localized kind of sin. We have seen how the position in the transcendental hierarchy influences the responsibilities for an individual in regards to the sins of the collective, such as the kingly duty to take on the lion’s share of either and absolve the subjects of the sin incurred by whatever evil act is demanded of them by the king.</p>
<p>A central theme of The Prince is the preservation of reputation by the means of delegation of dishonourable tasks. Machiavelli presents the example of Cesare Borgia, who assigned the job of pacifying Romania to Messer Ramiro de Lorqua. Afterwards, Cesare Borgia has de Lorqua brutally murdered and his corpse displayed in public; this sates the Romanian people’s bloodlust, shifting the blame from Borgia onto his second in command and dissolving it by his death (Machiavelli, VII). We have seen earlier the way a king must take on the subjects’ sin on his own head. However, a king must avoid contempt if he is to secure himself power over his people.</p>
<p>Let us return to the example of Moses. When he finds some of the Israelites have created an idol to worship in God’s place, he orders: “Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour” (EXOD 32:27). Over 3000 Israelites are slaughtered by their brethren that day—and it is neither truly at the hands of the soldiers wielding the swords nor the mouth of Moses giving the order by which these Israelites were murdered; it is by the word of God.</p>
<p>Over a dozen centuries later, Jesus Christ himself infamously declares: “If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple” (LUKE 14:26). The transcendental hierarchy preordained by the Divine will must come first; it is not the jealousy of God nor the arrogance of kings which demands the maintenance of this order, but the very essence of the Christian code of ethic. Thus both Williams’ failure to recognize King Henry in his disguise and Pilate’s decision to have Jesus crucified are not only justified in retrograde but already absolved by the very nature of the transcendental hierarchy. <sup>“</sup>When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it.” (MATT 27:24)</p>
<p>The essential role of the Christian King is the reception of sin which his people consign to him. Pilate, being neither Christian nor a king, refuses to take on the sin of his subjects as a governor and thereby exposes them to the infamous blood curse: “Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children” (MATT 27:25). It is only Jesus on the cross, a true Christian King, who restores the transcendental order by the reception and absolution of sin: “Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do” (LUKE 23:34). Jesus is mocked by the crowd who urge him to save himself if he is truly the son of God and he indeed has saved others (LUKE 23:25-37). However, he cannot do so not due to a physical impossibility but by the very fact of being king to his own murderers. His crucifixion is his penance for the sins of his people, which have been surrendered to him through his kingship. Thus the king of Jews must die for their sins, as must every Christian King for the sins of his followers; God invariably responds with the absolution—the sin never ultimately belongs to his creations, for He creates no evil and governs over all the world.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The most famous misreading of Machiavelli’s argument is that ‘the end justifies the means’. If an argument can be simplified as a very long ‘if’ statement, Machiavelli’s would be something like ‘if you want power as a king, then follow these tips’. The Christian King needn’t find discord between his code of ethic and Machiavelli’s political advice, so long as his cause is just and his quarrels honourable. Indeed, the Christian code of ethic demands that the king be more than a mere man, subject to the morality of individuals; God rules over every king as every king rules over each minister, and thus the plan laid out by God cannot be the concern of a king—just as Williams is saved from responsibilities through his surrender to a king, so must a king’s sins be absolved if it be the will of God that lead him to commit them in the first place. The Machiavellian preservation of transcendental order by the Christian King is the Divine will of God par excellence.</p>
