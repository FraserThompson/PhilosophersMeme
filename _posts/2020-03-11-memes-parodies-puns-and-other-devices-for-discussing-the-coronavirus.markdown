Consider the fact that you will never experience most memes. You won't even learn that they existed. Not only do you experience a filtered Internet through a series of mediators, there are simply too many memes in the world to see, and you only have so much time. So you see just a small percentage of them throughout your life. The spread of memes from one part of the Internet to your computer is a selective process. Ultimately, only a few memes survive the trip. Over time, memes evolve to become more and more infectious as the weaker elements are culled through competition.

Now, consider China censoring the very mention of COVID-19. Ordinary discussion, particularly criticisms of how the PRC government has handled the outbreak, is censored. However, people want to access information and discussions about COVID-19. Naturally, they turn to memetic techniques that were already established in advance to circumvent the censorship:

> "Censors in China make it nearly impossible for subversive memes to go viral, but Badiucao said he’s seen a few attempts from afar. One was a play on Li’s so-called letter of reprimand from the Wuhan police forcing the doctor to acknowledge with two fingerprints that he had spread false rumors. To evade censors, an artist created a copy of the document devoid of writing but whose meaning was unmistakable because of the remaining presence of Li’s fingerprints."
