excerpt: "Introduction\n\nThis is a diagram I made back in 2015 illustrating the stylistic
  differences between different eras and mediums of visual humor. I took the same
  joke premise, which comes from an old newspaper comic, and embedded it into different
  styles of memes for comparison. The initial purpose of using the same exact joke
  in each image was to standardize the narrative and more clearly illustrate the stylistic
  evolution, eliminating distractions for an audience that was potentially unfamiliar
  with memes. \n\nWhile my chart was done for educational purposes, this type of meme-ification
  of conventional jokes is actually a really common phenomenon. In the early internet
  days, people often made compilations of jokes in text form in order to share them
  online. Nowadays, more often than not, what could be considered conventional, ordinary
  jokes are packaged and told in meme form and shared on social media instead. So
  this got me thinking, what about the reverse process? What about memes that originate
  online and then migrate outwards? Why is it so often the case that meme-originated
  jokes retold in meatspace are met with awkward silence and averted eyes? Perhaps
  this bad reception isnâ€™t simply the fault of the clumsy joke re-teller or of the
  circumstances of social appropriateness, but to a certain extent, an emergent property
  of the medium itself? In order to better understand the inner workings of visual
  humor, I decided to do some investigation.\n\nThe first place I decided to look
  was puns. \n"
