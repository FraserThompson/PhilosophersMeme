excerpt: "'The History of Philosophy summarized & visualized' by Deniz Cem Önduygu,
  Hüseyin Kuşçu and Eser Aygün is the best interactive map of its kind I've seen.
  It doesn't just link names or sprawl into an unusable ball of connections. Instead,
  it lists representative arguments made by each of the philosophers and links them
  by their relationship with other arguments."

There's a marvelous quote by Otto Rank, a psychoanalyst whom Freud consdered his heir until Rank's deviation from Oedipal theory destroyed their relationship: 'for the time being I gave up writing—there is already too much truth in the world—an over-production which apparently cannot be consumed!' I think of it very often. Facing up to the endlessly expanding sea of truth is cause for a kind of existential sea sickness, and I am prone to the feeling because of my own fragility. I'm always glad to stumble upon things that help cope with the overproduction of truth.

'The History of Philosophy summarized & visualized' by Deniz Cem Önduygu, Hüseyin Kuşçu and Eser Aygün is the best interactive map of its kind I've seen. It doesn't just link names or sprawl into an unusable ball of connections. Instead, it lists representative arguments made by each of the philosophers and links them by their relationship with other arguments. Clicking on one of the arguments brings the related arguments closer to make them easy to read side by side. There is also a search function and you can filter by subdiscipline.

The one-line summaries of the arguments are quite well written (sometimes directly quoted from the authors) and easy to understand. Most of them are sourced from 'The Story of Philosophy' by Bryan Magee and 'Contemporary Philosophy' by Thomas Baldwin, and the source can be checked by clicking on the book icon that appears when you click on an argument.

It's a pretty massive map. If you guys find any parts that are interesting, put them in the comments or bring them to the chat. I'd love to have a look at your finds.

PS. An interesting treatment of the history of philosophy in a related vein is 'The Sociology of Philosohies' by Randal Collins. It's a tome at 1120 pages and maps out various traditions of philosophy around the world based on the intellectual, social networks between thinkers. It's quite interesting, so I'll post some diagrams from it to the page when I next have time to pick it up.
