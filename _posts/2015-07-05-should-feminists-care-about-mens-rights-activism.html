<p>There is a charge against feminism in the first world: that it has become co-opted as a tool in an internal power struggle for the academic posturing of ivory tower intellectuals, sensationalist media and internet celebrities. The most nuanced and loudest accusations of this sort come from the men’s rights activists, who feel that feminism has run its course and become a counterproductive force which does more harm to gender equality than good. Often what is seen as an over-problematized non-issue such as men spreading their legs too wide in public transport (‘manspreading’) is referred to as evidence.</p>
<p>Such criticisms are commonly brushed off with one counterargument: “you’re committing the fallacy of relative privation”. This fallacy of relative privation involves the derailment and dismissal of an argument by pointing out that there are bigger problems that should be prioritized instead (e.g. starving African children). An argument is fallacious in this way if it insinuates that only the most important issue deserves attention and discussion, because it is an attack on the act of bringing up an issue rather than the opponent’s argument itself. Often used just to shoot down an argument by insinuating that things could be worse, it comes in various forms of thought-terminating clichés.</p>
<p>However, neither the suggestion that an issue is relatively insignificant nor that more pressing issues exist is fallacious on its own. Consider relatively insignificant feminist issues (compared to say, how suffrage was) like manspreading—the existence of more pressing concerns does not justify neglecting lesser problems by any means (in a perfect world everyone has good manners), but criticism of their frivolity is not only not fallacious but an important point in the light of the fact that there is room for only so many issues in the spotlight of social concern. It’s certainly a more important point than how men sometimes take up two people’s worth of space on the train.</p>
<p>The underlying problem then is the inconsistency of rejecting points made about relative privation whilst simultaneously pushing for more awareness of feminist issues on the grounds that men’s issues deserve less attention because they are comparatively insignificant. The overt problem is the way discourse between popular feminism and its critics pans out: all too often an argument will devolve into either the dismissal of the criticism on the grounds that every issue matters in its own right and thus ought not to be criticized for its relative insignificance, or a fundamental dismissal of the right for others to criticize those who are in a position of lesser power (e.g. ‘mansplaining’).</p>
<p>If first world feminism deserves a platform despite the lesser urgency of its issues as compared to the past or the third world, then perhaps men’s rights deserve a platform, too. Let us examine the history of feminism qua Islam before we further pursue this line of thought; Western feminist rhetoric has been applied to Islamophobic disinformation campaigns from as early as the Crusades, in which Muslim men were characterized as polygamous marital rapists who believed women were literally soulless (and forced them to wear choking garbs that covered them from head to toe). In turn, the Muslimahs themselves were portrayed as fragile damsels in distress—effectively one more loot of war for the Christians to win from the heathen brutes. This xenophobic perspective would persist through the colonial era, to the 20<sup>th</sup> century, and even into our modern times, repeatedly evoked by politicians and Western feminists alike. Such maltreatment of Islamic culture naturally created backlash against Western mores: the Islamic Revolution of Iran for instance saw the revocation of Western feminist laws that had been put in place by the nationalist Shah, which had outlawed the veil, clerical chador and polygamy.</p>
<p>This longstanding tradition of disinformation about Islamic culture resulted in an endemic insensitivity among Western feminists not only to women’s issues in Islamic cultures overseas but also in intersectional issues regarding Islam within Western society. From the obsession with the veil to the popular, generalized argument against religion (and Islam in particular) as an inherently patriarchal and oppressive institution, popular Western feminism inherits the exclusionary nature of the first wave in its treatment of Muslims. Needless to say, numerous feminists are also Muslims, but rather than provided a chance to voice their own perspectives they are all too often marginalized and written off as the oppressed and helpless victims of false consciousness—in need of rescue by the enlightened Western feminists. First world feminism has inherited a colonialistic, oversimplified view of Islam in an attempt to further its narrative of ‘The White Woman’s Burden’.</p>
<p>In a pluralistic society, composed of various cultures and traditions, this colonialistic attitude can apply between other groups within one nation, such as between feminists and non-feminists. The fundamental unifying virtue of pluralism is tolerance: such as that practiced by a feminist who doesn’t stereotype a woman wearing a hijab as a willing slave to her husband. Consider the fact that if Western feminism can be considered a culture, so can Western ‘masculinism’ or the men’s rights movement (and on another level, masculinity as a whole). The tactics utilized by first world feminists against men such as condemning them for taking up too much space in public or being loud and opinionated, while firmly grounded in women’s issues and interests, deny the value of the male voice—even when it comes from a place of disprivilege (how often do the upper class ride a bus?). The very triviality of these problematized behaviours reflects the pervasive extent to which personal behavior is policed (whether it be spread legs or hijabs). The recent sensationalizing of manspreading by the media is a prime example of the modern reinvention of colonialist arguments for the bio-political oppression of the ideological other. In much the same way that they accuse Islamic cultures of treating Muslimahs, first world feminists are forcefully imposing their own moral values and standards of correct behavior onto men; precisely the same way that the Western feminists approach the issues Muslimahs face.</p>
<p>A common argument evoked against the men’s rights movement is “feminism is about gender equality; feminism is about men’s rights too”.  A common argument goes that because gender inequality always harms men as well as women, feminism effectively subsumes masculinism as a whole. Just as common is the argument from the shared goal of gender equality: since feminism is about the achievement of gender equality (through the balancing act of improving women’s rights in order to catch up to the privilege of men), it must be that masculinists, who claim to be against gender inequality, must merely be confused to-be feminists. First world feminism is about men’s rights as much as Western feminism is about the rights of Muslimahs; the call to combine the terms feminist and masculinist into ‘egalitarian’ is mistaken in the same way. To claim that the feminist cause is even functionally synonymous with that of masculinism is to argue for a trickle-down effect of rights.</p>
<p>That is not to say that all cultures are necessarily equal and thus corresponding criticisms are illegitimate. On the contrary, we have thus far examined first world feminism in a rather harsh light, criticizing its internal contradictions. However, it has also been an example of criticism which takes into account the views of those criticized. As such, tolerance is not incompatible with skepticism; shared values provide a platform for meaningful discourse which often prove far more fruitful than the forceful imposition of allegedly superior values, and certainly more so than an evasion of discourse due to the fear of intolerance. In our pluralistic societies, we require cooperation through centralizing common values with tolerance at the very basis. A feminist who sincerely values pluralism and equality, and not the mere advancement of a particular group’s interests, ought to value that minimum virtue of tolerance. That is the way to salvage first world feminism from becoming just another component of cultural imperialism. A good place to start is by supporting masculinity—as a culture in its own right.</p>
