I don't think this aspect is something you can commandeer as evidence for the narcissist interpretation. The movie isn't first person and although the dichotomy is obvious to the audience, the audience is meant to identify with Neo - who doesn't realise the difference on his own despite him being the narcissistic focal point - I think you at least have to mention that the primary reason the colour change is there isn't to comfort audiences into thinking they'd know the difference but literally just so they know the difference within the film and don't get confused.
    Overall either build on the narcissism angle more - and explain it. Or cut it out as it distracts from the rest of the essay.";}}}

<p>The Matrix is a great film, but a poor articulation of Baudrillard's philosophy of simulation.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<div>
<p>Directed by the Wachowski (then) brothers and released in come on don't play that game you've seen The Matrix.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>One of the central lessons people take away from the film is that "maybe this world isn't real" and "if the world wasn't real, how could you ever know?". It's an interesting philosophical conundrum, but it shows that they weren't watching the movie properly.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>I.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Think about it for 15 seconds, why would an inability to distinguish between reality and simulation constitute a failure to pay attention in this film? Take a look at these pictures:</p>
<p><a href="https://crouchingrooster.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/2030f-matrix.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2030f-matrix.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="400" height="258" border="0" /></a></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Note that the real world is blueish, grey and generally cold looking but grimy. The Matrix has a green tint, looks somewhat grainy and the backgrounds are edgy and monotone (aside from some reflection).</p>
<p>It's clear at every point in the film which is the real world and which is not. Even though the film provokes people to imagine that the world they know might not be real, it gives them a clear 'out': you'd just know if you weren't in the real world, things would just be off somehow in a way that you would notice. Just check: is everything green? Yes? Matrix.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>We could pick up on that thread as to why this idea appeals to so many people (i.e. knowing that they are the special snowflake that would detect the fakery and somehow know that their mundane life can't be reality), but that's perhaps a topic for another time. What I'd like to discuss here is a minor part that everybody glosses over but actually provides a great opportunity to really understand the nature of simulation in the way that Baudrillard described.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>Scene: Neo and the other human survivors are having dinner outside the Matrix. Their dinner is some kind of grey slop and they joke about it as Neo scrunches his face up. The food here doesn't taste great, the matrix had proper food with really nice tastes, even if it was only simulated. This is the first level of simulation: Neo has hitherto only ever eaten in the Matrix: matrix food is all that he's eaten, but at least it was as good as the real thing right?</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>Not right. While they are eating, they discuss the cliche that "everything tastes like chicken".</p>
<p>The kid (who I think is actually called 'Kid') sitting next to Neo suggests that perhaps the reason why everything tastes like chicken is because the machines never knew what most foods tasted like, so they just made everything taste similar to chicken.</p>
<p>This is the second level of simulation: the meat Neo has eaten in the Matrix is like a knock-off of the real thing, it's <em>like</em> beef/mutton/shark/whatever, but just not as good. Anyway, still beats the crap in front of them.</p>
<p>IV.</p>
<p>Hold onto your ass though, because we aren't done here: none of these people have ever eaten chicken, so how do they know what it tastes like? They compare everything to chicken, but they've never eaten a real one. This is level three; the symbol masks the absence of a reality.</p>
<p>In discussing their food, they use the symbol of 'chicken', but that symbol just serves to hide the fact that none of them have ever eaten chicken before.</p>
<p>V.</p>
<p>Finally though, we reach level four, where the symbol has lost all connection to any kind of reality. At this level the symbol masks the absence of <em>any</em> reality whatsoever. It is a symbol that refers to it's own reality.</p>
<p>Explanation: Who's to say that the symbol 'chicken' has any kind of referent in reality? None of these surviving humans has ever even <em>seen</em> a chicken.... they have no clue whether or not chickens ever actually existed on earth, let alone what they taste like.</p>
<p>All the humans have is data fragments stolen from the Machines after the machine-wars. They have no guarantee that any of the data there is reliable.</p>
<p>The taste of 'chicken' then is a pure simulation. It no longer requires a referent in reality; it exists purely in it's own logical space, not necessarily anchored to any specific real concept, and even if it is, they could never know it.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>VI.</p>
<p>For Neo and the others, there can be no recourse to reality here. The very experience itself is not guaranteed to have any relationship to a real concept, and yet because it exists, Neo and the others can enter the Matrix, order KFC and smack their lips while they're munching "MMmm, tastes so authentic!!". Baudrillard often seems to argue that we operate at this fourth level, trading in symbols that are pure simulation: we could never know whether they reference real concepts or not, and to some extent it might not be important because those symbols take on their own reality and form their own logical space.</p>
<p>VII.</p>
<p>Change film: In <em>Inception</em>, Leonardo DiCaprio's character, Cobb, spins a top at the end of the film before running out to meet his estranged children. Throughout the film, we're told that totems like a spinning top can be used to test reality: to see if you're still in a dream. In the real world the top has to fall, but in the paradoxical dream-world the top can spin endlessly.</p>
<p>The film's final scene cuts before we have enough of a chance to find out if the top will fall or not. Cobb has finally reunited with his children after overcoming the spectre of his dead wife (whose death he feels responsible for) but the top is left spinning before the cut to credits, leaving us to wonder whether any of this seemingly ideal ending is real.</p>
<p>Many film-goers were driven to despair by the ambiguous ending, immediately setting about trawling the film for possible clues as to which parts of the film are dreams and which parts real, and how they might be used to signal whether the ending of the film is real or just another dream.</p>
<p>The lesson from Baudrillard would be that not only is it impossible to tell - indeed, the film is purposefully obscure about this at times - but that it might not even matter.</p>
<p>VIII.</p>
<p>Watch the ending scene again and what do you notice? Here, my point is illustrated in this shot:</p>
<p><a href="https://crouchingrooster.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/d3290-inception.png"><img class="aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/d3290-inception.png?w=300" alt="" width="400" height="200" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Can't see it? Don't look at the top, that's a red herring. A distraction. Think presence in absence. Ask yourself: "what's not in this shot?</p>
<p>Think about it for half a minute, I'll wait.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>Cobb. Cobb isn't in this shot. He already turned away from the top to go and hug his kids, and he's busy walking onto the idyllic patio with them right now.</p>
<p>Cobb doesn't care whether the top falls or not. It doesn't matter to him, what matters to him is that his feelings of guilt have been dissolved and that he's able to face his children.</p>
<p>What does this have to do with simulation? Freud told us that dreams are not simulations of the real world, but instead they are wish-fulfilment fantasies. The dream has it's own reality and it's own meaning to the dreamer, and the effects of the dream can be as real to the dreamer as reality itself.</p>
<p>Perhaps the entire film was one huge dream. Maybe Cobb's wife never died. Maybe he doesn't even have children... everything is a symbol operating in it's own space. The point is that there is some evolution, some change and that's what matters to Cobb. He couldn't see his children at the beginning of the movie, now he can. He was haunted by his wife, now he's reached some absolution. Just because the symbols don't have referents in reality, it doesn't make them any less meaningful -- to Cobb.</p>
<p>Focusing on the real/dream dichotomy is a great way to miss the point of Inception. What mattered to Cobb wasn't whether the world he knew was real, but rather his existence and operation within that world. He didn't stick around to watch the top because in that moment it was immaterial to him whether the world was real or not. In this way, <em>Inception</em> is not only cinematically inspired by <em>The Matrix</em>, but is a continuation of the theme after 11 years of soul-searching in between films. The world no longer exists (was constructed) for the protagonist, but the protagonist's own journey and experiences are now her reality.</p>
<p>It's worth asking ourselves why so many people were rooting for the top to fall. Why, in essence, we have such a strong aversion to another person's fantasy/reality.</p>
<p>IX.</p>
<p>We live in a world that is utterly steeped in symbolism and simulation. The term 'capitalism' doesn't refer to any physical thing, and in fact it refers to something completely cooked up, but that doesn't make it any less real on it's own terms.</p>
<p>Symbolism, simulation and the nature of metaphor are often left behind in various analyses because they are complex and difficult to grasp, however to ignore them completely is to essentially swallow the blue pill. If you really want to escape the Matrix, you need to find new ways of looking at things. New perspectives.</p>
<p>To paraphrase Žižek (which is a habit of mine, here and in real life), instead of deciding between the red pill -that shows him reality behind the illusion- and the blue pill -which keeps him in thrall to the illusion and away from reality-, Neo should have demanded a third option, one that makes it possible for him to experience the reality in the illusion itself. To see how illusion becomes it's own reality.</p>
