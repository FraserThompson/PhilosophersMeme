<p style="text-align:left;">In which we only see what we already know.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><!--more--><a href="https://scontent-lhr3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xtf1/v/t1.0-9/11407051_1626902960927377_5033120021971911257_n.jpg?oh=ce61eb71af6c5ab11ec516539b9e8ae2&amp;oe=55EB81A7"><img class=" aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/11407051_1626902960927377_5033120021971911257_n.jpg?oh=ce61eb71af6c5ab11ec516539b9e8ae2&amp;oe=55EB81A7" alt="" width="320" height="240" border="0" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">A photograph taken in the midst of the Ferguson protests in America. Before we get po-mo on this, let's hear what the photographer has to say about this scene.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:left;">“I thought, what a great scene. A powerful scene. A scene with a message that needed to be communicated.” – Johnny Nyugen (photographer)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:left;">A powerful message. Really? Johnny has his own interpretation on what that message is though, so let's not allow artist intention to cloud our judgement: what is the message of this photograph?</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I.</p>
<p>The mainstream reading of  this picture is that it shows common human desire for peace and reconciliation. Despite the the open wound of the events at Ferguson, in fact <em>because</em> of their shared pain, the two are able to be brought together in the spirit of reconciliation.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">II.</p>
<p>Another reading might point out that while the boy looks distressed, the policeman looks quite serene, almost patriarchal. There's no need to delve into post-Freud Freudianism here, but suffice it to say that any reconciliation in this photograph is not happening between equals; the young boy is returning to the arms of the father. The reconciliation can only occur on the terms of the authority.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">III.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I've got another proposition for you, but you might not like it. There's a woman in the background taking another photograph, yet we see the scene from this angle. Why is that?</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">"It's a better picture!"</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Better in what way?</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">"It shows the faces of the policeman and the kid".</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Yes, and it also shows somebody else in the background taking their own picture.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">"So?"</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">This picture resonates with you because you're in it too. That camera phone girl? She's you.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">"I wasn't there..."</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">And now you are, vicariously. You're participating in the whole scene through her, but what can she see that you can't?</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">"The kids back?"</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The camera that took this picture. Does this photo look like it was taken on a camera phone?</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">"Well, I hear the Samsung Galaxy has a really nice..."</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Of course it wasn't. Even the lighting is almost too perfect.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">IV.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">You're purposively shown this scene because it feels meaningful and you're in it. You don't get to choose the framing. You get to participate in the picture and all you had to pay for admittance was to forfeit your right to choose your own framing. Don't believe me? Take your own picture; nobody will see it unless it confirms what this picture already shows your intended audience.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I mean more than just the composition of the photo. TV news or a magazine like TIME can 'frame' this picture by literally putting it in a frame. They get to choose the context in which the photo appears and then they get to choose what this photograph means. When you first saw this photograph, the interpretation of what it means was coloured by the context in which it was presented.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The framing of an issue can totally collapse the space of interpretation onto distinct possibilities; this photograph becomes about reconciliation or about authoritarian dominance. As soon as you start arguing over the conclusions, you miss the chance to question the form of the argument.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">V.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">So what is the powerful message? In the words of Marshall McLuhan: 'The medium is the message'. Here, the very facts of this photo and it's existence in the public sphere are the message: the person who frames the photo gets to describe reality, and they have an HD camera.</p>
