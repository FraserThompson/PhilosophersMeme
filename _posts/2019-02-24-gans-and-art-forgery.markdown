Art forgery involves a forger creating an artwork that resembles another artist's work in order to pass it off as that artist's own, often to sell it for a lot of money. Forgery therefore has two components: the identity of the mimicked artist, and the style of the artist's works. 

Forgery often attracts outrage from the participants of the respective aesthetic community. At its most basic, forgery is the misattribution of blame and praise for a work, and the outrage is about the betrayal of expectations. The peculiar thing is that the experience of forgery is not uniform across different types. The misattribution of man-made works to another person or to a nonhuman entity is felt differently from the misattribution of machine-made works to a person.

Art forgery became an economic, moral issue when the valuation of artworks became closely tied to their creators' identities. Prior to artworks becoming a commodity with economic value much beyond their immediate aesthetic utility, forgery was standard, for both the buying and selling of art but also the development of artists themselves. Apprentices would mimic the style of the master by copying the master's works, and the master would sell the works created in the process instead of receiving monetary payment for the tutorship. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) applied to visual tasks work rather similarly to a forgery-based apprenticeship. One part of the network randomly generates new images and the other assesses each image for fit. The network is trained to become better at creating and selecting the kinds of images demanded by the human supervisor, namely images stylistically similar to the images on which it is trained. It's like an apprenticeship with neither an apprentice nor a master.

A favourite defence of forgers is to claim that the fake artworks are a kind of Sokal challenge to the artworld, and that they expose the hypocrisy of a market which treats artworks as autographs and currencies rather than appraises them for their *intrinsic* value. This classic argument implies that the forgeries were justified on grounds of holding independent, intrinsic value as works of art and artistic statements of their own. It's part of a family of arguments which claim that forgery is justified as an artistic practice because the forger, too, is an artist. It's a good argument, because it's true: contemporary art is currency trading. Paradoxically, it's an unconvincing one given that traditional forgery requires enough artistic skill to produce convincing copies. The fakes themselves are highly limited in supply, and so they end up also fetching high prices based on the same market pressures as the originals even after they are revealed as fakes. Infamous forgers like [Han van Meegeren][Meegeren.net - HAN VAN MEEGEREN - BIBLIOGRAPHY] sometimes even develop their own forgery markets, in which lesser-known forgers misattribute their own works to the well-known forger to inflate their value.

Machine-made art inverts this paradigm by successfully removing the forger altogether. Consider that [copyright law generally does not apply][Art Law Journal - Steve Schlackman: Who holds the Copyright in AI Created Art] to works created by non-humans. Computers can't hold the right to deny or authorise others to use their works based on copyright. Even when made to fake the work of a human artist, they are at most tools of forgery. But more importantly, a network can produce endless amounts of original content once it has been properly trained. When fakes are no longer scarce and fatigue regarding authenticity becomes generalised, the perception of art as ultimately bound to a work, physically embodied in the original, will become anachronistic. The scales will further tip against the influence of institutions and economies that depend on this anachronistic view of art as objects for their survival, in favour of other views of art as a complex of activities, experiences, the artwork itself a form of life.

But even machine-made art is not free of fakes. An example is the forgery of automatically generated content on botpages. Botpages are a subgenre of memepages whose content is generated by bots. Generally, posting to a botpage as an admin is frowned upon, unless it is to make an update or an announcement. Forging content to pass it off as created by the bot is verboten. The premise of a botpage is that all of its content is generated by the bot with indirect tweaks and adjustments from its creator, and part of the appeal is often to read into a senseless and randomly generated message. Content that is serendipitously transparent in its interpretation is treasured by botpage fans as a source of botpage lore, yet somewhat infrequently remixed as material for memes and original content.

There is therefore a strong incentive for the admins to forge more interesting and coherent content than their bot usually generates, in order to inflate interest in their bot. More, since a human artist cannot expect to compete in volume with the actual output of the bot, these man-made posts are more likely to be based on a stereotype of the bot's output than strict mimicry of either the process or a typical product of the bot.

Creators in all genres of computational creativity are similarly incentivised to forge computational output, encouraged by a culture of gatekeeping mysterianism, in which keeping both source code and techniques secret — or sufficiently vague as to prevent replication — is routine. For instance, David Cope of "Experiments in Musical Intelligence" claimed to have created an AI called Emily Howell that he taught to write music, but never released any evidence of it other than the purportedly AI-created music. Internet commentary on Emily's music is full of people marvelling at the soul apparent in the music. Art created by AI is usually awkward, strange and flawed, but to imagine it was produced by a machine adds a sense of purity of aesthetic intention. There is no author, whose intended meaning and hidden motivations constrain the interpretation of the work. There is only the artistic object and the viewer. This evokes the paradoxical experience of knowing that there is nothing behind the work, and feeling that it is entirely permitted to read meaning and emotions into the work. This paradoxical experience is often something very private that catches people off guard, and so the betrayal of the viewer's trust in that context is much more offensive than, say, a magic trick. Academics who have critically reviewed David Cope's claims about his computational process with Emily Howell, and in some cases debunked them, affirm this sentiment:

>Either Cope is joking (but it's not very funny), or he's being musically naïve (which seems unlikely given his experience as a composer) or he's assuming his readers are musically naïve (which seems insulting). I don't know which.

[Wiggins 2007, p. 114][Wiggins 2007]

But in the context of botpages, not everyone agrees that an adminpost is fraudulent. Many botpage admins understand their page as a part of a creative process which they are involved in as the artist, and resent the fact that many botpage fans do not see the output of their bots as works by the admins themselves. The opposing views on the authorship of bot-generated content have a fundamentally divergent effect on the viewers' experience, which feeds back into the bot itself through community practice.
