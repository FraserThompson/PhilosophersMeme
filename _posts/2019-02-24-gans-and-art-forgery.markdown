Art forgery involves a forger creating an artwork that resembles another artist's work in order to pass it off as that artist's own, often to sell it for a lot of money. Forgery therefore has two components: the identity of the mimicked artist, and the style of the artist's works. 

Forgery often attracts outrage from the participants of the respective aesthetic community. At its most basic, forgery is the misattribution of blame and praise for a work, and the outrage is about the betrayal of expectations. The peculiar thing is that the experience of forgery is not uniform across different types. The misattribution of man-made works to another person or to a nonhuman entity is felt differently from the misattribution of machine-made works to a person.

Art forgery became an economic, moral issue when the valuation of artworks became closely tied to their creators' identities. Prior to artworks becoming a commodity with economic value much beyond their immediate aesthetic utility, forgery was standard, for both the buying and selling of art but also the development of artists themselves. Apprentices would mimic the style of the master by copying the master's works, and the master would sell the works created in the process instead of receiving monetary payment for the tutorship. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) applied to visual tasks work rather similarly to a forgery-based apprenticeship. One part of the network randomly generates new images and the other assesses each image for fit. The network is trained to become better at creating and selecting the kinds of images demanded by the human supervisor, namely images stylistically similar to the images on which it is trained. It's like an apprenticeship with neither an apprentice nor a master.
