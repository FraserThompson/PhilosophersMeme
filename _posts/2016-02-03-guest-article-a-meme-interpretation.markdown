<p><em>This unedited post originally appeared in the <a href="http://facebook.com/groups/memetics" target="_blank">discussion group</a>.</em></p>
<p><strong>By Matheus Henrique.</strong></p>
<p>Before anything, I'd like to say that I've been a long time lurker and a long time fan of the group and that this is my first post and attempt at an in-depth analysis on memes as epistemological and aesthetical subjects. I also would like to say that I've been heavily influenced and inspired by Ryan's "Sample Classification of Facebook Memes" wonderful and brilliant post as well as Seong's great compilation work (couldn't tag neither, sorry).<br />
As a first post, I want to analyze one of Parallel Universe Meme's videos and share my interpretation with you, so that I can further develop my understanding of memes as something more than the superficial element of humour that they initially present themselves as, as more than merely comedy palliatives. What I may say here may already be common knowledge for many of you, so please bear with me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, without further do, I shall begin: I believe this video is art. I believe it is art in it's rawest form. A post-modern work of art, to be exact. That which leaves you wondering, as Duchamp put it, it's "enigmatic, misteriously provocative and silent", thus fulfilling it's duty as art completely. Also, apart from some of it's contemporary works of post-modern art, I believe this video is truly beautiful. (A more common example in the Underground would be Gondola, a personal favorite of mine).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As most works of art, it provides an insight, or at least it means to portray something, and for that it's interpretations are subjective, are sublime, are delicate. But I personally believe this specific work is about transcendence and infinity. Most of the memes shown here are micro-memes (as Ryan put it), and they flow through what seems like a 4th+ dimensional space. They are through a constant state of metamorphosis (or change, if you prefer), pick two random frames and they're completely different one from the other, even though they may seem like the same "face" of the tesseract. It seems like it may well go on forever, but in the end the video is zoomed out and we can get a clearer shot of what's going on. The tesseract is in front of a wall, another plane if you will, and it as well the tesseract, changes itself. They (the faces) seem endless, and it's many combinations seem endless as well, it all obviously has some surrealistic pointees to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, if you've seen the video, you've obviously know what I'm talking about. What does this mean and why would this associate with concepts as transcendece and infinity? To begin with, the very plane this all takes places is obviously beyond our own, three-dimensional beings, and as such it's beyond our capacity to fully understand what exactly is going on. But as we focus on the everchanging frames and faces of the tesseract, we can see that even tough they're all micro-memes, they're all different from each other, be it on their layers of irony or on their humour punchline.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We, too, are in constant change. "You never step on the same river twice". In a moral, ethical and biological sense (and many others), we're always different from what we were. This is it. We must become conscious of this infinite change, this infinite metamorphosis, and use it as a tool to go beyond ourselves, to transcend. We are made of infinite spectrums, of emotions and rationalities and punchlines, that are everchanging. Just like some memes serve metalinguistical purposes, we are left to make ontological observations of ourselves using what's within our reach: ourselves. We are meme expressions of ourselves, and with this expression, we must go further, untill we can become something beautiful as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please, tell me what you think onto this interpretation. If you think it's a complete load of bullshit, if you agree, if you have different views, I'd love to see them. If you'd like to add something, start another discussion, please go ahead, I'm extremely curious to see what the other members think of this.</p>
