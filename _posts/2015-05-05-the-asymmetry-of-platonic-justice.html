<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>In The Republic, Glaucon succeeds Thrasymachus’ argument that ‘might makes right’. Glaucon begins his challenge by categorizing all good things into three categories: those “which we welcome for their own sakes”; “which are desirable not only in themselves, but also for their results”, and those good “only for the sake of some reward or result which flows from them” (Plato, Republic 2.357b-358a). Let us refer to these three categories as ‘intrinsic goods’, ‘hybrid goods’ and ‘instrumental goods’ respectively. Though Glaucon and Socrates (i.e. Plato) agree here, they disagree as to which of these justice belongs. The Republic’s definition of justice may be summarized as the maximization of benefit and the minimization of harm (2.358e; 2.379b). Glaucon’s argument is that a just act often results in harm for the individual acting justly, and even though it sometimes does incur benefit, it is never done for its own sake but out of greed for that benefit. Glaucon thus argues that justice is either only instrumentally good from time to time, as in the latter case, or not good at all, as in the former case. Plato on the other hand argues that it is a hybrid good (2.358a). Glaucon’s challenge then, is for Socrates to show not only that justice is good in itself but also necessarily good instrumentally, since he already agrees it is instrumentally good on occasion.</p>
<p>Let us resist the urge to appeal to the world of forms as a response to Glaucon. He is not making a nihilistic argument against ethics as a whole but only objective ethics (the notion that justice is intrinsically valuable); we needn’t delve into Plato’s metaphysics to answer it. Instead we shall focus only on Plato’s argument for the intrinsic goodness of justice. Let us examine Plato’s theory of justice by comparing the individual with the state, which Plato believed to mirror the individual in its structural essence. I argue here that this model of state-individual symmetry is mistaken and that what is referred to simply as justice in fact consists of two parts: the intrapersonal and the interpersonal. I argue that intrapersonal justice is a trait of the individual whilst interpersonal justice is a component of the state, and conclude that Glaucon’s challenge can be at least partially met by the explication of this distinction, which then reveals that intrapersonal justice is a hybrid good and forms a positive feedback system with interpersonal justice and the health of the individual. However, in illuminating this fact I come to the conclusion that the intrinsic goodness of intrapersonal justice is antinomic to that of interpersonal justice— showing that Plato only partially succeeds in answering Glaucon’s challenge.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>JUSTICE, HEALTH AND HEALTHINESS</strong></p>
<p>Plato begins his examination of justice by first examining the state, claiming that the nature of justice for an individual will be more easily discernible by analysing its expression on a larger scale, which appears in a state (2.368e-2.369a). Here I argue that justice of a state and an individual do not form a true symmetry, and the former is merely a plural network of the latter. In other words, a state is not a superorganism resembling a macroscopic individual but only a collective of individuals who form interpersonal relationships with one another.</p>
<p>Interpersonal justice is a trait of a relationship between multiple individuals but not of any single member, since the relationship is conceptually inseparable from either individual, as it denotes the mutual influence and relative situation among the respective individuals as a unit, though not a trait of any particular individual by himself. However, whether each individual is just, though it is never confined solely to this factor alone, partially determines the justness of the relationship. The concept of intrapersonal justice is thus quite necessary in order to salvage Plato’s argument. We may develop it further through clarifying the definition of health.</p>
<p>The particular conception of health which I will use here has already been loosely elaborated in Plato’s instructions for education in his ideal society: that one individual be confined to one way of life or a class (2.370b); that the education vary appropriately for each class (2.374e); and that the population be protected from harm which originates both from within and without the state by those raised in this way as guardians (2.373e-374c). The properly raised individual is one who has been allowed to begin reaching for the optimal state which his potential allows, through adequate environment, education and resource. Let us refer to the full satisfaction of the individual’s natural potential as ‘self-completion’, and the state of being on the path to self-completion ‘health’. The individual’s potential can be understood simply as his natural propensity to certain occupations, which includes both talent and preference. Let us take for granted that talent and preference are, at least to some significant degree, innate, overlapping and usually aligned.</p>
<p>Plato argues that an object of desire is by definition a good object for the subject of that desire, in that the subject’s desire determines the object’s goodness for the particular individual (4.437e). In other words, desire instils instrumental goodness in an object in relation to the individual who experiences that desire. As it is an object of desire by definition, health is always instrumentally good. Since health can also be characterized as the satisfaction of particular desires, namely of self-completion, it is also intrinsically good and therefore a hybrid good.</p>
<p>Justness is the preference for justice and aversion to injustice. Therefore, healthiness, an individual’s tendency to actively resist harm and prefer health, is identical with what we have hitherto referred to as intrapersonal justice. Health, then, is the result of a just relationship with oneself, in the same way other relationships such as a family or a society may be just. However, health is not the tendency to promote more justice; the relationship is at least unidirectional but not necessarily self-sustaining. Though health does not necessarily result in a tendency to justice, justice involves health by definition: an individual in an interpersonally just relationship is healthier he would be otherwise, by the virtue of fulfilling that very potential of justness. Contrast this with the intrapersonally just individual who is not necessarily in a state of greater health but is merely healthy, thus improving the likelihood of achieving that state of greater health in the future as a consequence.</p>
<p><a href="https://crouchingrooster.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/dsfaafsdasfd.png"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-104 aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/dsfaafsdasfd.png?w=300" alt="dsfaafsdasfd" width="300" height="232" /></a>Thus we can see that interpersonal justice and intrapersonal justice are in fact asymmetrical, as the directionality of the two regarding health are mirror images. Intrapersonal justice, which is conducive to but not necessary for health, does not necessarily lead to more intrapersonal justice, and health does not necessarily lead to more health or to interpersonal justice but instead is conducive to and necessary for interpersonal justice, which in turn is conducive to but not necessary for intrapersonal justice. Finally, we can see that the result of interpersonal justice is a positive feedback loop between interpersonal and intrapersonal justice, rather than the ‘health’ of a state as Plato claims (2.372e).</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>THE PROBLEM OF DEVILS</strong></p>
<p>Thus far, I have demonstrated that intrapersonal justice is a hybrid good which is instrumentally good in regard to health and intrinsically good as an inseparable component of health. On the contrary, interpersonal justice cannot be characterized as intrinsically good since it is not a trait of an individual but a relationship amongst multiple individuals. It is, as Glaucon argues, not even always effective as an instrumental good, often resulting in relatively fewer gains than deceptive interpersonal injustice (2.360d). In order to show that interpersonal justice is distinct from other instrumental goods such as guise and reputation of justice, or worse still, a mere side effect of such goods, we must examine the extreme cases in which it is so strongly advantageous for the individual to be unjust that health and justice will seem at odds with one another.</p>
<p><a href="https://crouchingrooster.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/pig.png"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-105 aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pig.png?w=300" alt="pig" width="300" height="276" /></a>Prima facie, most people are not perfectly unjust. They at least to some degree desire health, and therefore also at least to some degree desire justice both for its own sake (as health, i.e. interpersonal justice) and as a means (for health, i.e. intrapersonal justice). Since Glaucon’s challenge is not a demand for Socrates to prove that justice is an all-overriding good which is always prioritized over other goods but merely that it is valued as a hybrid good at all, showing that it is necessarily valued should be a sufficient answer. Not so in the case of interpersonal justice. Though influenced by health, interpersonal justice is not a component of health in the same way intrapersonal justice is, as it is not a trait of the individual but rather his relationships with other individuals. The relationship between intrapersonal justice and interpersonal justice is analogous to that between a pig and an apple tree: the tree (intrapersonal justice) grows (intrapersonal justice influencing health) apples (health) which are eaten (health influencing interpersonal justice) by a pig (interpersonal justice), whose excrement nourishes (interpersonal justice influencing intrapersonal justice) the tree.</p>
<p>The fact that both health and healthiness are traits of an individual means that one cannot be healthy (that is, have an increased tendency towards actions which are conducive to a superior state of health) without being in a superior state of health as a result; healthiness itself is an aspect of the individual’s state of health. Unlike healthiness (i.e. intrapersonal justice) and health, interpersonal justice is not a component of the apple tree (i.e. individual justice) despite being connected to it. Therefore interpersonal justice cannot be good in the same way intrapersonal justice (i.e. healthiness), which is not only instrumentally good but also intrinsically good. Having thus accepted defeat in this particular aspect, we may nonetheless attempt to defend the instrumental goodness of interpersonal justice. We shall now examine the problem of the perfectly unjust man, for whom ordinary injustice is healthy and ordinary justice is unhealthy.</p>
<p>A perfect individual is in a perfect state of health, whether he is perfectly just or perfectly unjust. Gods are perfectly good beings and by definition cannot change for the better; devils are perfectly bad, and cannot change for the worse. They do not change at all, since all change for them insofar as they are concerned must be for the worse (2.381b-2.381e). As all deific justice (that is, justice towards a god either from himself or others) consists purely of freedom from harm, intra-deific justice and inter-deific justice are nonsensical terms; one cannot benefit a god, only harm him. Perfectly good beings, which are also perfectly just beings, must therefore completely lack the need of a state and its justice. The case is reversed for ‘demonic justice’. Devils require other beings which they may constantly harm, since to not harm is to be good, which is injustice unto themselves.</p>
<p>However, is this “injustice” unto the self not, insofar as it is unjust, in agreement with the purely unjust nature of the devil? It would seem that one cannot simultaneously be perfectly unjust and be perfectly healthy, since one component of healthiness is intrapersonal justice. Even the most unjust individual must be at least minimally just. Therefore devils are impossible. What remains now is the problem of the perfectly selfish individual. Glaucon’s position can be seen as a kind of psychological egotism, a framework under which the sole possible intent behind any action is self-interest (intrapersonal justice or otherwise), and justice is never truly in the interest of the self-interested individual but only strategically. In other words, even its instrumental value arises out of the strategic limitations and not any characteristic unique to interpersonal justice itself.</p>
<p>In retaliation, Plato must show that even for the purely self-interested individual, justice is valuable as an instrument of self-interest by necessity. This is not the same thing as showing it to be intrinsically good, such as in the case of intrapersonal justice when we demonstrated it to be an inseparable component of another intrinsic good, namely health. Instead Plato must show that interpersonal justice is a necessary component in the achievement of some other good regardless of the nature of that other good. Consider the case of the omnipotent and self-interested individual, exemplified by Gyges: Glaucon’s argument for egotism relies upon the premise that an individual will always act in the way which maximizes his gains and minimizes his loss to the extent his situation allows (2.359a–2.360d). Plato cannot disagree with this notion without contradicting our earlier argument for the equalisation of intrapersonal justice and healthiness, which is also our defence against the claim that people are necessarily and essential amoral. It would seem that an argument for intrinsic goodness of intrapersonal justice is at irreconcilable odds with that for interpersonal justice.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>Given that self-interested acts which do not harm others are just acts (rather than amoral or immoral), we may wish to argue that life is not a zero sum game where one man’s gain necessarily involves another’s loss. This would provide at least an opening for an enquiry into whether interpersonal justice is usually instrumentally valuable. But the frequency with which this claim proves true or false is a matter of empirical evidence and out of the scope of this essay. Further, we are sure to face the rather Hobbesian response that since no individual can ever have the precise resource as another every gain necessarily incurs a cost onto others deprived of the precise and specific experience.</p>
<p>Even if we can show that interpersonal justice is a superior health strategy in comparison to injustice, this does nothing to prove it is necessarily valuable: we cannot show that something necessarily has instrumental value without either showing that it is an essential component of some intrinsic good or at least an essential precondition for it. The former would then be to show that it is also intrinsically good (which, as we have seen, interpersonal justice is not) and the latter cannot be done without supposing that things for which interpersonal justice is crucial, such as ‘the health of the state’, has intrinsic value. Whether such an intrinsic good for which interpersonal justice is a necessary ingredient is still an open question out of the scope of this essay. Glaucon’s challenge must be left only partially resolved for now.</p>
