<p>The problem is causality. And no: shouting at me won't make it less true.<!--more--></p>
<p>If you think the problem is that kids have it too easy, parents are only superficially interested/involved in their children's education or even that teachers aren't empowered enough (all good points)... you're not seeing the problem: you're seeing <em>symptoms</em>.</p>
<p>You're looking at the picture, but you aren't <em>seeing </em>it. The problem isn't that the system has changed for the worse. That's too easy. Everybody gets to feel better about themselves that way.</p>
<p>1969 wasn't a better time. 2016 isn't a failure to live up to the ideals of the past. 2016 is a direct product of 1969.</p>
<p>The <em>problem</em> is that the kid on the left is the dad on the right.</p>
