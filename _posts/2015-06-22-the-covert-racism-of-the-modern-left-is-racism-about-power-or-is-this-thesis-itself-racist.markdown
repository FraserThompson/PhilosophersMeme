<p>The racism of the right tends towards the vulgar and petty, such as distasteful stereotyping. The racism of the left tends to be much more nuanced; always politicized. Racism always take the form of ‘there may be exceptions, but as a whole…’: evidence to the contrary must be rationalized away as either partially (viz. outliers) or entirely invalid if a racist belief is to be maintained. The difference between left wing racism and right wing racism is in the process of this rationalization. In the case of right wing racism, it is that the negative preconceptions regarding a group are transferred onto an individual: the racist interaction is ultimately a deduction from the individual identity of a person and its substitution with an aspect of the racist perception of his race-group. In left wing racism, this process is inverted: exceptions are nullified on the basis of relationships between individual’s race-group as a whole with another race-group; the individual’s identity is not deducted from but rather added, wholesale, onto his race-group in its insurmountably massive entirety. An individual’s encounter with racism is therefore no longer about discrimination against an individual but a symptom of some power imbalance between race-groups: the individual is reduced to a mere component of his race-group. I cannot help but think that while the racism of the right tends to evoke a stronger emotional response, the racism of the left is as harmful as it is insidious and by far the more dangerous of the two.</p>
