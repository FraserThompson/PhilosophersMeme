<p>Trigger warning: reality ahead, and behind, and well, kind of around every corner.<!--more--></p>
<p>Trigger warnings... are you getting sick of that word yet? I've used it three times already, but if it's starting to grate on you, consider yourself lucky, because the word is far less abrasive than the <a href="http://dailynexus.com/2014-02-27/a-s-senate-passes-proposal-to-label-trauma-provoking-academic-content/">words and rhetoric</a> <a href="http://everydayfeminism.com/2015/07/opposing-trigger-warnings/">generally used</a> to <a href="http://privilege101.tumblr.com/triggers.html">argue for</a> them.</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>We're not going to get into a full-on deconstruction of individual pieces on trigger warnings... we've got other plans for the rest of this century. Instead, allow me to make the general remark that those people pushing for trigger warnings are often adamant that it is not censorious and is in no way related to a general compulsion to censor content. Which is just not true.</p>
<p>Firstly, there is the fact that there has always been a fringe of people who believe that challenging views ought to be no-platformed as a matter of course. An example would be speakers or <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/i-helped-shut-down-an-abortion-debate-between-two-men-because-my-uterus-isnt-up-for-their-discussion-9867200.html">debates that are anti-abortion</a>. That is <a href="http://new.spectator.co.uk/2014/11/free-speech-is-so-last-century-todays-students-want-the-right-to-be-comfortable/">real, genuine censorship</a> right there. What does it have to do with trigger warnings? It's often the same crowd who push for both of these things and the group attempting to no-platform speakers, do so by using (although not entirely relying on) the rhetoric of triggering. By claiming that a particular debate or discussion might be 'triggering', there is the subtle implication that such a debate ought not really take place. Tell me that calling something 'triggering' isn't subtly pejorative. It's a pre-judgement of the discourse masked as concern.</p>
<p>We don't even need to get into the logic of no-platform policies, but to pretend that there is no link between the two concepts is disingenuous. Is it so hard to say "I support trigger warnings but also acknowledge that there are genuinely censorious forces at play that I do not support"? Go ahead, support the concept of trigger warnings, but be aware that you may find yourself on the side of people who will exploit that for the purposes of political no-platforming and content censoring. If you support trigger warnings but are against censorship, then make that nuance clear! Lefties and progressives seem almost afraid to engage in nuanced debate between themselves these days (whilst being all too keen to kick the ball in the nuanced and complex long grass when talking to conservatives).</p>
<p>I'd like to see more people discussing the ethics of campus debate in terms of censorship and the ways in which impulses to censor are implicitly employed rather than explicitly, but I'll also grant that analysing our own attitudes might not allow us to feel as self-righteous as just banning opposing views does.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>Another favourite of pro-trigger-warning arguments is the concept of 're-victimisation'.</p>
<p>Let's not get ahead of ourselves. First, we ought to acknowledge that the whole concept of trigger warnings and the language we use to discuss it is a product of the psychology of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A 'trigger' in this framework is a mostly sensorious, (i.e. sounds, smells, sights) event that provokes immediate feelings of stress and anxiety (sometimes accompanied by recall/reexperience of the original traumatising event).</p>
<p>It's a medical term, and the concept of warnings was intended in aid of PTSD sufferers who may be 'triggered' by similar sensations to those of the traumatising event. Many sufferers of PTSD can be 'triggered' by totally unrelated events however. Victims of assault and terrorist attacks (among others) have often reported being triggered by smells or sounds that were particularly prominent in their minds moments before the event.</p>
<p>So, when we discuss trigger warnings, are we discussing this medical usage of the term? I've read many debates and articles on the issue, and I have no idea.</p>
<p>It seems that when it's convenient, the debate centralises around the very real phenomena of triggering as experienced by PTSD sufferers and it's weight as a clinical condition, but then the notion becomes incredibly broad when it becomes time to discuss who is allowed to invoke the notion of triggering. Seemingly anybody who claims to be triggered and to be experiencing trauma legitimately is experiencing those things, which is certainly not the standard of the medical usage of the term. You simply can't claim a medical term and clinical condition as free-territory for anybody and everybody.</p>
<p>Whenever you attempt to raise a concern with the kind of implications/ramifications an open-season on this kind of medicalisation might have on the standards, form and ultimately, flexibility of debate (let alone the <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/sci-tech/2013/01/why-i-dont-agree-trigger-warnings">clinical effectiveness of such approaches</a>)... you are immediately accused of 're-victimising' sufferers (even though we have not established what it is they may be suffering from). Nobody is blaming victims for suffering victimisation, because it simply is not re-victimisation to ask whether usage of certain terms and identifications is genuine or legitimate. I realise that asking these questions might be very uncomfortable... but discomfort has no place in a meaningful discussion.</p>
<p>I know some of you are getting ready to burn me at the stake right about now. Keep on building the pyre: I'm so full of rum I'll probably explode and take a few of you out with me anyway, but hear me out first:</p>
<p>Progressive politics seems to be locked to this idea of assigning special privileges/dispensations for particular groups, but then completely shutting down debate or investigation into whether people are members of that group. For me to question whether somebody is really entitled to claim that they are traumatised immediately makes me a devil beyond saving (hence the pitchforks and torches).</p>
<p>That doesn't change the fact that by making this special dispensation, there will be people who can and will exploit it.</p>
<p>"Nobody would do that"</p>
<p>I wish everybody was as honest and ethical as you, but not everybody else in the world will shy away from a chance at transactional power that comes from claiming special dispensations, especially when they are taking part in debate about issues they are passionate about.</p>
<p>How do we go about deciding who gets legitimate use of this term/dispensation, and should such a courtesy be granted when we're debating? Shying away from touchy subjects is a great way to prevent people from thinking about them, and unfortunately that also means we never get a chance to persuade people that they are wrong.</p>
<p>Quite aside from the fact that there is no real reason to believe that trigger warnings are empirically viable or useful. As mentioned before, the majority of PTSD triggering experiences are sensorious rather than intellectual (talking about war doesn't necessarily make veterans anxious, but being in an enclosed space or smelling burning grass might). There's no real evidence that trigger warnings provide any significant relief.</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>Finally, here's a quote from <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/commentisfree/2015/aug/18/trigger-warnings-dont-hinder-freedom-expression">Lindy West</a> which neatly summarises most progressives views on the matter:</p>
<blockquote><p>Maybe we can all get flippant and condescending about trigger warnings after we build a world where more than 3% of rapes lead to conviction, where we don’t shame and blame people for their own victimisation, where men don’t feel entitled to women’s bodies, and where millions of people aren’t moving through life yoked with massive, secret traumas.</p></blockquote>
<p>I mean, what are you meant to say to that?</p>
<p>We can easily and uncontroversially agree that all of the things she listed are very real problems. Rape conviction statistics are literally insane (only 1 in 20 arrests leads to a conviction), victim shaming and victim blaming are massive issues (that I will likely be accused of owing to this piece despite me never doing either of them), male entitlement harms both women and men in physical and psychological ways and the lack of open discourse on psychological illness means that millions feel that it's taboo to mention their problems in the open or otherwise fear being stigmatised (depression being just one example).</p>
<p>The problem is, it's not clear to me at all how trigger warnings actually address any of those problems. They actually hinder debate on those things by smuggling in the implication that we <em>shouldn't</em> talk about those things at all.</p>
<p>And really... what are you meant to say to that? How can I possibly disagree with her now that it's implied that by not treating trigger warnings seriously, I'm implicitly supporting rape, victim shaming, misogyny and stigmatisation of sufferers of mental illness. Rather than support nuance in debate, this kind of statement seems to basically place landmines across the entire dialectic... one slip toward an undesired direction and the entire grounds for debate is exploded underneath you.</p>
<p>IV.</p>
<p>The whole dialectic boils down to recrimination and acrimonious fallout precisely because of the censorious attitude of many of the proponents of trigger warnings. Once again, politics takes precedence over philosophy and the rhetorical tricks are used to neatly guide the dialectic along predetermined paths that concord with the prejudices of the discussants.</p>
<p>For the record, I don't even think trigger warnings are an entirely bad idea -just the slapdash way they are invoked and often the way they are argued for- but I often feel totally prevented from raising concerns with them because so many of the so-called progressive left (of which I consider myself a member) have a mentality of "you're either fer us or agin us" which, when anybody dares to break rank and question the party-line, results in being branded as the worst kind of monster.</p>
<p>Okay okay I'll get on the pyre now, but seriously, I warned you about the rum...</p>
