<p>The Philosopher’s Meme is an experiment in distributed research into Internet culture. It is at once a series of projects, a network of users, and a consortium of contributors. Though there is a diversity in approach, The Philosopher’s Meme is unified by its focus on the philosophy of the Internet -- from a systematic taxonomy of memetic lineages to tender-hearted stewardship of art communities, we engage both the theoretical and practical aspects of our field.</p>

<p>The Philosopher’s Meme believes in a new politics of the Web: a pragmatic, education-oriented democracy on the Internet, for the Internet. We believe that all the right things can be learned from all the wrong places. The ecosystem of Web cultures and Internet memes has been treated as anodyne for too long. In the swill of low art and heterodox media, there is serious work to be done.</p>

<h1>Projects</h1>

<h2><a href="facebook.com/thephilosophersmeme">Facebook Page</a></h2>

<p>The first among TPM’s many projects, our meme page began as</p>

<h2>Discussion Groups</h2>
<h4><a href="facebook.com/groups/sophismo">Internet culture research</a> - <a href="facebook.com/groups/memetics">General discussion</a></h4>

<p>Without spaces in which to collaborate, a network of users is impotent. /tpm/ and /tpmg/ serve as formal and informal discussion groups, respectively, in which to share knowledge and make connections needed for more involved efforts. These spaces are not only proving grounds for our theories of governance, but instrumental in their iterative development.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ThePhilosophersMeme">Youtube Channel</a></h2>
<p>The Philosopher’s Meme works to provide educational content in diverse formats. We feature video content on our Youtube channel.</p>

<h2>Gondola</h2>

<p>The Philosopher’s Meme supports memetic biodiversity. We operate an eco-sanctuary dedicated to the conservation of Gondola, an endangered species of Post-ironic meme.</p>

<p>We believe in the necessity of unifying content creators from across the Web. The Internet Memeticists Union seeks to provide open source access to tools and research necessary for effective self-governance and political action, beginning with a memepage info-sharing portal. It is our hope that through the data-mining of the meager data which Facebook makes available to content creators, we might see through the opaque, automated apparatuses of governance under which we labor.</p>
