<h1>Projects</h1>

<h2><a href="https://www.facebook.com/thephilosophersmeme">Facebook Page</a></h2>

<p>This memepage was the first of our projects and initially intended to exhibit experimental journalism and memetic art. It was among the very first serious-minded ironic memepages to come out of the Weird Facebook boom. We began with a focus on the artistic and educational significance of Internet memes, but soon became interested in memes in themselves. This change of direction towards taking memes seriously as objects of study culminated in pioneering research and the development of our broader community. As of October 2016, the page has over 136,000 likes and specializes in edutainment by creating and sharing quality original content and reading material. </p>

<h2>Discussion Groups</h2>
<h4><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/sophismo">Internet culture research</a> - <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/memetics">General discussion</a></h4>

<p>Without spaces in which to collaborate, a network of users is impotent. /tpm/ and /tpmg/ serve as formal and informal discussion groups, respectively, in which to share knowledge and make those social connections needed for more involved efforts. These spaces are not only proving grounds for our theories of governance, but instrumental in their iterative development.</p>

<h2>Gondola</h2>
<h4><a href="https://www.facebook.com/gondolaspace/">Page</a> - <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/gondolaspace/"><nobr>Artist Collective</nobr></a></h4>

<p>The Philosopher’s Meme supports memetic biodiversity. We operate an eco-sanctuary dedicated to the conservation of Gondola, an endangered species of Post-ironic meme.</p>

<h2><a href="http://imu.onl">IMU.onl</a></h2>
<p>We believe in the necessity of unifying content creators from across the Web. The Internet Memeticists’ Union seeks to provide open source access to tools and research necessary for effective self-governance and political action, beginning with a memepage info-sharing portal. It is our hope that through the mining of the meagre data which Facebook makes available to content creators, we might see through the opaque, automated apparatuses of governance under which we labor.</p>

<p>The Philosopher’s Meme website serves as a repository for long-form content related to the philosophy of the Internet.</p>
